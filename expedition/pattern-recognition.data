While pure logic can solve any well-designed puzzle, spotting patterns can dramatically speed up your solving process and reveal elegant solution strategies.\n\n## What Is a Pattern?\n\nA **pattern** is any regularity or structure that appears in a puzzle. Patterns can take many forms:\n\n- **Numerical sequences**: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32... (powers of 2)\n- **Symmetries**: Mirror reflections, rotational symmetry\n- **Repetitions**: The same structure appearing multiple times\n- **Relationships**: Consistent connections between elements\n\n## Why Patterns Matter\n\nRecognizing patterns helps you:\n\n1. **Reduce cognitive load** - Process information more efficiently\n2. **Spot shortcuts** - Find elegant solutions instead of brute-forcing\n3. **Verify solutions** - Patterns often indicate you're on the right track\n4. **Transfer knowledge** - Apply techniques across different puzzles\n\n:::hint\nNot every puzzle has obvious patterns, and not every pattern you spot is meaningful. Pattern recognition is a tool, not a magic solution!\n:::\n\n## Types of Patterns to Look For\n\n### Arithmetic Sequences\n\nNumbers that increase or decrease by a constant amount.\n\n**Example**: 3, 7, 11, 15, 19...\n- Difference: +4 each time\n- Next number: 23\n\n### Geometric Sequences\n\nNumbers that multiply by a constant factor.\n\n**Example**: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48...\n- Ratio: ×2 each time\n- Next number: 96\n\n::::puzzle\n**Sequence Challenge**\n\nWhat comes next in this sequence?\n\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ?\n\n:::hint\nLook at how each number relates to the previous numbers (not just the immediately previous one).\n:::\n\n:::solution\nThe answer is **34**.\n\nThis is the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers:\n- 1 + 1 = 2\n- 1 + 2 = 3\n- 2 + 3 = 5\n- 3 + 5 = 8\n- 5 + 8 = 13\n- 8 + 13 = 21\n- 13 + 21 = **34**\n:::\n::::\n\n### Symmetry Patterns\n\nSymmetry appears when parts of a puzzle mirror or repeat in predictable ways.\n\n**Types of symmetry:**\n- **Reflection symmetry**: Mirror image across a line\n- **Rotational symmetry**: Looks the same when rotated\n- **Translational symmetry**: Pattern repeats by shifting\n\n:::hint[Using Symmetry]\nIf a puzzle has symmetry, the solution often respects that symmetry too. Use this to reduce the problem space!\n:::\n\n## Pattern Recognition Practice\n\nLet's apply pattern recognition to a classic puzzle:\n\n::::puzzle\n**The Handshake Problem**\n\nAt a party with 10 people, everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once. How many handshakes occur?\n\n:::hint\nStart with smaller numbers. How many handshakes with 2 people? 3 people? 4 people? Look for a pattern.\n:::\n\n:::hint[Building a Pattern]\n- 2 people: 1 handshake\n- 3 people: 3 handshakes\n- 4 people: 6 handshakes\n- 5 people: ?\n\nCan you spot the pattern?\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Pattern Discovery**\n\nLet's build the sequence:\n- 2 people: 1 handshake\n- 3 people: 3 handshakes (previous + 2)\n- 4 people: 6 handshakes (previous + 3)\n- 5 people: 10 handshakes (previous + 4)\n- 6 people: 15 handshakes (previous + 5)\n\nPattern: Each time you add a person, they shake hands with everyone already there!\n\nFor 10 people:\n- Start with 2: 1 handshake\n- Add person 3: +2 = 3 total\n- Add person 4: +3 = 6 total\n- Add person 5: +4 = 10 total\n- Add person 6: +5 = 15 total\n- Add person 7: +6 = 21 total\n- Add person 8: +7 = 28 total\n- Add person 9: +8 = 36 total\n- Add person 10: +9 = **45 total**\n\n**Formula**: For n people, the number of handshakes is n(n-1)/2 = 10(9)/2 = 45\n:::\n::::\n\n## When Patterns Mislead\n\nNot every pattern continues as expected!
