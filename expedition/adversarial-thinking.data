Some involve an **adversary**—an opponent trying to prevent you from reaching your goal, or puzzle elements that work against you. This requires a different kind of thinking: **strategic reasoning**.\n\n## What Is Adversarial Thinking?\n\n**Adversarial thinking** means reasoning about situations where:\n- Multiple agents have conflicting goals\n- Your success depends on anticipating others' moves\n- You must choose actions that work even under worst-case opposition\n\n**Key concepts:**\n- **Worst-case analysis**: What's the best you can guarantee?\n- **Minimax**: Maximize your minimum outcome\n- **Game trees**: Visualizing all possible play sequences\n- **Dominant strategies**: Moves that are always good, regardless of opposition\n\n:::hint\nIn adversarial puzzles, don't just ask \"What's the best move?\" Ask \"What's the best move assuming my opponent plays perfectly?\"\n:::\n\n## Example: The Chocolate Bar Game\n\n::::puzzle\n**The Chocolate Bar Game**\n\nYou and an opponent have a 6×8 chocolate bar (48 squares). Players take turns:\n- Break the chocolate along a vertical or horizontal line\n- Take one piece and give the other to your opponent\n- The player who gets the last single square wins\n\nYou go first. Can you guarantee a win? What's your strategy?\n\n:::hint\nThink about invariants. What doesn't change as the game progresses?\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Analysis:**\n\n**Key insight:** Every break increases the number of pieces by exactly 1.\n\nStarting: 1 piece\nAfter 1 break: 2 pieces\nAfter 2 breaks: 3 pieces\n...\nAfter 47 breaks: 48 pieces (all single squares)\n\n**The game lasts exactly 47 moves** (to go from 1 piece to 48 pieces).\n\n47 is odd, so:\n- Player 1 makes moves 1, 3, 5, ..., 47 (24 moves)\n- Player 2 makes moves 2, 4, 6, ..., 46 (23 moves)\n\n**Player 1 makes the last move and wins!**\n\n**Strategy:** It doesn't matter what moves you make! As the first player, you're guaranteed to win by parity. Just break anywhere—you'll make the 47th and final move.\n\nThis is an example where **understanding the game structure** matters more than individual moves.\n:::\n::::\n\n## Minimax Reasoning\n\n**Minimax** is the foundation of strategic thinking: You maximize your minimum guaranteed outcome.\n\n**The reasoning:**\n1. Consider all your possible moves\n2. For each move, assume your opponent responds optimally (worst case for you)\n3. Choose the move that gives you the best worst-case outcome\n\n### Example: The Coin Game\n\n::::puzzle\n**The Coin Game**\n\nTwo piles: 3 coins and 5 coins.\n\nPlayers take turns removing any number of coins from a single pile (at least 1 coin, up to the entire pile).\n\nThe player who takes the last coin wins.\n\nYou go first. What's your optimal strategy?\n\n:::hint\nWork backwards from winning positions. What positions guarantee a win for the next player?\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Working backwards:**\n\n**Winning positions** (opponent has no good move):\n- (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), ... - One pile empty, you can take all from the other pile\n- (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), ... - Same, symmetric\n\n**Losing positions** (all your moves lead to winning positions for opponent):\n- (1, 1) - Whatever you do, opponent faces (0, 1) or (1, 0) and wins\n- (2, 2) - Whatever you take, opponent can mirror and reach (0, 0)\n- (3, 3), (4, 4), etc. - Symmetric positions are losing\n\n**Key insight:** If both piles have equal size, you lose. If they differ, you win by equalizing them!\n\nStarting position: (3, 5)\n**Optimal first move:** Take 2 from the pile of 5, leaving (3, 3)\n\nNow the opponent faces a symmetric position. Whatever they do, you mirror:\n- If they take X from one pile, you take X from the other pile\n- You maintain symmetry until you make the last move\n\n**You win with perfect play!**\n:::\n::::\n\n## Game Trees\n\nA **game tree** visualizes all possible game states and transitions.\n\n**Structure:**\n- Root: Initial state\n- Nodes: Game states\n- Edges: Possible moves\n- Leaves: Terminal states (win/lose/draw)\n\n**Minimax on game trees:**\n1. Label leaves with values (win = +1, loss = -1, draw = 0)\n2. Work backwards: each node's value is the best its player can guarantee\n3. Max nodes: player maximizes value\n4. Min nodes: opponent minimizes value (from your perspective)\n\n:::hint[Simplifying Game Trees]\nMany game trees are too large to fully explore.
