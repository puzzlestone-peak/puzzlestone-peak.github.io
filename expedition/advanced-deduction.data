Now let's explore more sophisticated reasoning techniques that can crack even the toughest puzzles.\n\n## Proof by Contradiction\n\n**Proof by contradiction** (also called *reductio ad absurdum*) is a powerful technique:\n\n1. Assume the opposite of what you want to prove\n2. Follow the logical implications\n3. Reach a contradiction (something impossible)\n4. Conclude that your assumption must be false\n\n::::puzzle\n**The Infinite Primes Puzzle**\n\nProve that there are infinitely many prime numbers.\n\n:::hint\nAssume the opposite: that there are only finitely many primes. What would that mean?\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Proof by contradiction:**\n\n**Assume** there are only finitely many primes. Let's list them all: p₁, p₂, p₃, ..., pₙ\n\nNow consider the number N = (p₁ × p₂ × p₃ × ... × pₙ) + 1\n\n(This is the product of all primes, plus 1)\n\n**Key observation:** N is not divisible by any of the primes in our list!\n- Dividing N by p₁ leaves remainder 1\n- Dividing N by p₂ leaves remainder 1\n- And so on for all primes in our list\n\n**Two possibilities:**\n1. N itself is prime (but it's not in our list!)\n2. N has a prime factor (but that prime isn't in our list!)\n\nEither way, we found a prime not in our \"complete\" list. **Contradiction!**\n\nTherefore, our assumption was wrong. There must be infinitely many primes. ∎\n:::\n::::\n\n## Case Analysis\n\n**Case analysis** (also called *proof by exhaustion*) means systematically checking all possibilities.\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. Divide the problem into distinct cases\n2. Solve each case separately\n3. Combine the results\n\n:::hint\nThe key to good case analysis is making sure your cases are:\n- **Exhaustive**: Cover all possibilities\n- **Mutually exclusive**: Don't overlap\n:::\n\n### Example: The Chameleon Puzzle\n\n::::puzzle\n**The Chameleon Puzzle**\n\nOn an island, there are chameleons in three colors:\n- 13 red chameleons\n- 15 green chameleons\n- 17 blue chameleons\n\nWhen two chameleons of different colors meet, they both change to the third color.\n\nExample: If a red and green meet, both become blue.\n\n**Question:** Can all chameleons eventually become the same color?\n\n:::hint\nThink about invariants. What numerical property is preserved when chameleons change color?\n:::\n\n:::hint[Consider Modulo 3]\nLook at the differences between color counts modulo 3.\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Solution using case analysis:**\n\nLet's denote the counts as (R, G, B).\n\nStarting: (13, 15, 17)\n\n**Key insight:** Look at the differences modulo 3:\n- R - G ≡ 13 - 15 ≡ -2 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n- G - B ≡ 15 - 17 ≡ -2 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n- B - R ≡ 17 - 13 ≡ 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3)\n\n**When two chameleons meet:**\n- If red and green meet: (R-1, G-1, B+2)\n- Differences modulo 3 remain: 1, 1, 1\n\n**This is an invariant!** The differences modulo 3 never change.\n\n**For all chameleons to be the same color** (say all red):\n- Final state: (45, 0, 0)\n- R - G ≡ 45 - 0 ≡ 0 (mod 3)\n\nBut we need R - G ≡ 1 (mod 3), which is impossible!\n\n**Answer:** No, they cannot all become the same color. The invariant modulo 3 prevents it.\n:::\n::::\n\n## Multi-Layer Deduction\n\nSometimes you need to make deductions about deductions—thinking about what others know or can deduce.\n\n### The Muddy Children Puzzle\n\n::::puzzle\n**The Muddy Children** (3 children version)\n\nThree children are playing. Each gets mud on their forehead (or doesn't). Each can see the others' foreheads but not their own.\n\nTheir father says: \"At least one of you has mud on your forehead.\"\n\nHe then asks repeatedly: \"Can anyone deduce if they have mud on their forehead?\"\n\nAssume all three actually have mud. What happens?\n\n:::hint\nThink about what each child can deduce from the others' responses.\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Multi-layer reasoning:**\n\n**Round 1:** Father asks, \"Can anyone deduce if they have mud?\"\n\nEach child thinks:\n- Alice sees Bob and Carol both have mud\n- Alice thinks: \"If I don't have mud, then Bob would see only Carol with mud. Bob would deduce he has mud (since father said 'at least one'). But Bob isn't answering...\"\n- All three children remain silent (none can deduce yet)\n\n**Round 2:** Father asks again.\n\nAlice thinks:\n- \"Bob and Carol also stayed silent in Round 1\"\n- \"If I didn't have mud, Bob would have reasoned: 'Alice has no mud, Carol has mud. If I (Bob) have no mud, then Carol would have deduced she has mud in Round 1. But Carol didn't. So I must have mud.' But Bob didn't deduce this in Round 1.\"\n- \"Therefore, I must have mud!\"\n\nAll three children reach this conclusion simultaneously in Round 2 and answer \"Yes!\"\n\n**The key:** Each round of silence provides information. The children use the fact that others couldn't deduce to make their own deductions.\n:::\n::::\n\n## Working with Constraints and Deductions\n\n### Chaining Deductions\n\nOften, one deduction enables another, which enables another:\n\n**Example chain:**\n1. Alice is not in Room A (given)\n2. Bob is in Room A or Room B (given)\n3. Carol must be in Room C (given)\n4. There are only 3 rooms total\n5. Since Carol is in C, Alice must be in A or B\n6. But Alice is not in A (from 1)\n7. So Alice is in B\n8. So Bob must be in A (from 2 and 7)\n\n:::hint[Deduction Chains]\nWhen you get stuck, review what you've deduced so far. Often, combining two earlier deductions yields a new insight!\n:::\n\n## Proof Strategies Summary\n\n| Technique | When to Use | Key Idea |\n|-----------|-------------|----------|\n| **Direct proof** | Straightforward logical path | A → B → C → conclusion |\n| **Contradiction** | Hard to prove directly | Assume opposite, find impossibility |\n| **Case analysis** | Multiple scenarios | Check each case exhaustively |\n| **Induction** | Patterns that scale | Prove base case, then prove the step |\n| **Contrapositive** | Easier to prove the reverse | Instead of \"A → B\", prove \"not B → not A\" |\n\n## Practice Problem\n\n::::puzzle\n**The Birthday Puzzle**\n\nThree people (Alice, Bob, Carol) are asked when their birthdays are.\n\nAlice says: \"My birthday is before Bob's.\"\nBob says: \"My birthday is not in July.\"\nCarol says: \"My birthday is in the same month as exactly one other person.\"\n\nLater, you learn that exactly one of the three people lied.\n\n**Given facts:**\n- Alice's birthday is July 10\n- Bob's birthday is August 5\n- Carol's birthday is July 20\n\nWho lied?\n\n:::hint\nCheck each statement against the facts. Which one is false?\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Analysis:**\n\n**Alice's statement:** \"My birthday is before Bob's\"\n- Alice: July 10\n- Bob: August 5\n- July 10 is before August 5\n- Alice's statement is **TRUE**\n\n**Bob's statement:** \"My birthday is not in July\"\n- Bob: August 5\n- August is not July\n- Bob's statement is **TRUE**\n\n**Carol's statement:** \"My birthday is in the same month as exactly one other person\"\n- Carol: July 20\n- Alice: July 10 (same month!)\n- Bob: August 5 (different month)\n- Carol shares July with exactly one person (Alice)\n- Carol's statement is **TRUE**\n\n**Wait—all three statements are true!**\n\nBut we're told exactly one person lied. Let me reconsider...\n\n**The trick:** The question states \"later you learn exactly one lied,\" but all statements are true.
