These puzzles give you a set of constraints (rules) and ask you to find an assignment that satisfies all of them.\n\n## What Is a Constraint?\n\nA **constraint** is a rule that limits the possible values or arrangements in a puzzle.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Sudoku: \"Each row must contain the digits 1-9 exactly once\"\n- Logic grid: \"The person who likes pizza is not Alice\"\n- Map coloring: \"Adjacent regions cannot share the same color\"\n\n## The CSP Solving Strategy\n\nThe general approach to constraint satisfaction:\n\n1. **Identify all constraints** - List every rule explicitly\n2. **Start with certainties** - Fill in anything you know for sure\n3. **Propagate constraints** - Use constraints to eliminate possibilities\n4. **Make deductions** - When only one option remains, commit to it\n5. **Repeat** - Continue until solved or stuck\n\n:::hint\nIf you get stuck with no logical next move, you might need to make a hypothesis and test it. But in well-designed puzzles, you should rarely need to guess!\n:::\n\n## Example: The Housing Puzzle\n\nLet's solve a simple logic grid puzzle together.\n\n::::puzzle\n**Three Houses Puzzle**\n\nThree people (Alice, Bob, Carol) live in three houses (Red, Blue, Green) and have three pets (Cat, Dog, Fish).\n\nConstraints:\n1. Alice lives in the Red house\n2. The person in the Blue house has a Dog\n3. Carol does not have a Fish\n4. Bob does not live in the Green house\n\nWho lives where, and who has which pet?\n\n:::hint\nStart by filling in what you know for certain from constraint 1.\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Step-by-step solution:**\n\n**From Constraint 1:**\n- Alice lives in Red house\n\n**From Constraint 4:**\n- Bob doesn't live in Green\n- Since Alice is in Red, Bob must be in Blue\n\n**By elimination:**\n- Carol lives in Green house\n\n**From Constraint 2:**\n- Person in Blue house has Dog\n- Bob is in Blue house\n- Therefore: Bob has Dog\n\n**From Constraint 3:**\n- Carol doesn't have Fish\n- Bob has Dog (from above)\n- Therefore: Carol has Cat\n\n**By elimination:**\n- Alice has Fish\n\n**Final answer:**\n- Alice: Red house, Fish\n- Bob: Blue house, Dog\n- Carol: Green house, Cat\n:::\n::::\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Constraint Propagation\n\nWhen you fill in one value, it often triggers a cascade of deductions.\n\n**Example**: If Bob has the Dog, then:\n- Alice doesn't have the Dog\n- Carol doesn't have the Dog\n- Bob doesn't have the Cat or Fish\n\nEach constraint you satisfy constrains other variables!\n\n### Naked Singles\n\nIn Sudoku terms, a \"naked single\" is when only one number can go in a cell.\n\n**Strategy**: Scan for cells where all but one possibility has been eliminated.\n\n### Hidden Singles\n\nA \"hidden single\" is when a number can only go in one place within a region, even if that cell has other possibilities.\n\n**Strategy**: Look at each number and ask \"Where can this number go?\"\n\n:::hint[Two Perspectives]\nAlways look at constraint problems from both angles:\n1. \"What can go in this cell/position?\"\n2. \"Where can this value/item go?\"\n:::\n\n## Practice: Einstein's Riddle (Simplified)\n\nLet's try a more complex puzzle:\n\n::::puzzle\n**The Five Houses (Simplified)**\n\nFive houses in a row, each with a different color. Five people, each drinking a different beverage.\n\nConstraints:\n1. The Norwegian lives in the first house\n2. The person who drinks Milk lives in the middle house (house 3)\n3. The Norwegian lives next to the Blue house\n4. The person who drinks Coffee lives in the Green house\n5. The Green house is immediately to the right of the White house\n\nWhat color is the Norwegian's house?\n\n:::hint\nStart with constraints 1 and 2—these give you fixed positions.\n:::\n\n:::hint[Work Through Constraint 3]\nThe Norwegian is in house 1. The Blue house is next door. Which house is Blue?\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Solution:**\n\nFrom constraint 1: Norwegian is in house 1\n\nFrom constraint 3: Blue house is next to house 1\n- Must be house 2 (houses are in a row)\n\nFrom constraint 5: Green is immediately right of White\n- Possible positions: White-Green could be houses (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), or (4,5)\n- But house 2 is Blue, so not (1,2)\n\nFrom constraint 4: Coffee drinker lives in Green house\n\nFrom constraint 2: Milk drinker lives in house 3\n\nContinuing this logic:\n- If White-Green is (2,3): Blue is house 2, contradiction\n- If White-Green is (3,4): Green is house 4\n- If White-Green is (4,5): Green is house 5\n\nFrom constraint 4 + 2: Coffee is in Green, Milk is in house 3\n- So Green ≠ house 3\n- Therefore Green is house 4 or 5\n\nTesting possibilities... (full solution omitted for brevity)\n\n**The Norwegian's house is not Blue** (that's house 2), so it must be one of the remaining colors. Following all constraints, we can determine the exact color!\n:::\n::::\n\n## When to Use CSP Techniques\n\nConstraint satisfaction is perfect for:\n- Logic grid puzzles (Who-What-Where puzzles)\n- Sudoku and variants\n- Map coloring problems\n- Scheduling puzzles\n- Any puzzle with explicit rules about what can/can't coexist\n\n## Next Steps\n\nYou've learned the fundamentals of constraint satisfaction!
