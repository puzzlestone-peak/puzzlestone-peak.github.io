Unlike the informal strategic reasoning you've learned, CGT provides formal tools to completely analyze games and determine optimal strategies.\n\n## What Is Combinatorial Game Theory?\n\nCGT studies games with these properties:\n\n1. **Two players** alternating turns\n2. **Perfect information** - both players see the entire game state\n3. **No chance** - no dice, no randomness\n4. **Normal play** - last player to move wins (or misère: last player to move loses)\n5. **Finite** - game must end in finite moves\n\n**Examples:** Chess, Go, Nim, Tic-Tac-Toe, Chomp\n\n**Not CGT:** Poker (hidden information), Monopoly (dice), Infinite games\n\n:::hint\nCGT gives us tools to answer: \"Who wins with optimal play?\" and \"What is the optimal strategy?\"\n:::\n\n## The Game of Nim\n\n**Nim** is the foundation of CGT. Understanding Nim unlocks understanding of many other games!\n\n### Classic Nim Rules\n\nSeveral piles of objects. Players alternate:\n- Choose one pile\n- Remove any number of objects (at least 1) from that pile\n- Last player to move wins\n\n::::puzzle\n**Two-Pile Nim**\n\nTwo piles: 3 and 5 matchsticks.\n\nWho wins with optimal play? What's the strategy?\n\n:::hint\nTry small examples first. What about (1, 2)? (2, 2)? (1, 3)?\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Analysis:**\n\n**Key insight:** A position is a losing position (P-position) if all moves lead to winning positions (N-positions) for the opponent.\n\n**Small examples:**\n- (0, 0): Previous player took last stick - they won\n- (0, n) or (n, 0): Current player takes all from remaining pile - **N-position** (next player wins)\n- (1, 1): Any move leaves (0, 1) or (1, 0), both N-positions - **P-position** (previous player/current player loses)\n- (1, 2): You can move to (1, 1), a P-position - **N-position**\n- (2, 2): Any move leaves opponent at (0, 2) or (2, 0) or (1, 2), all N-positions - **P-position**\n\n**Pattern for two-pile Nim:**\n- (n, n) is always a **P-position**\n- (n, m) where n ≠ m is always an **N-position**\n\n**Strategy:** Equalize the piles!\n\nFor (3, 5): Take 2 from the pile of 5, leaving (3, 3). Now opponent faces a P-position, and you mirror all their moves until you win.\n\n**You win with optimal play!**\n:::\n::::\n\n## The Nim-Sum: XOR\n\nThe general solution to multi-pile Nim uses **XOR** (exclusive or).\n\n### Binary XOR Refresher\n\n```\n  3 = 011\n⊕ 5 = 101\n------\n  6 = 110\n```\n\nXOR bit-by-bit: 1 ⊕ 1 = 0, 0 ⊕ 0 = 0, 1 ⊕ 0 = 1\n\n### The Nim Theorem\n\n**Bouton's Theorem** (1901):\n\nA Nim position is a **P-position** (losing) if and only if the XOR of all pile sizes equals 0.\n\n**Strategy:** Always move to leave your opponent with XOR = 0.\n\n::::puzzle\n**Three-Pile Nim**\n\nPiles: 3, 5, 7 matchsticks.\n\nWhat's the optimal first move?\n\n:::hint\nCalculate the XOR. Then find a move that makes XOR = 0.\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Solution:**\n\n**Current XOR:**\n```\n  3 = 011\n⊕ 5 = 101\n⊕ 7 = 111\n------\n  1 = 001\n```\n\nXOR = 1 (non-zero), so this is an N-position. We can win!\n\n**Goal:** Find a move that makes XOR = 0.\n\n**Try:** Remove 1 from pile of 3 → (2, 5, 7)\n```\n  2 = 010\n⊕ 5 = 101\n⊕ 7 = 111\n------\n  0 = 000\n```\n\n**Perfect!** Move to (2, 5, 7). Now XOR = 0, and opponent is in a P-position.\n\n**General algorithm:**\n1. Calculate current XOR of all piles\n2. For each pile, calculate pile ⊕ XOR\n3. If result is less than the pile size, that's a valid move!\n4. Replace pile with (pile ⊕ XOR)\n\nThis always works when you're in an N-position (XOR ≠ 0).\n:::\n::::\n\n## The Sprague-Grundy Theorem\n\nThe **Sprague-Grundy theorem** generalizes Nim to all impartial games.\n\n### Grundy Numbers (Nimbers)\n\nEvery game position has a **Grundy number** (also called nimber):\n\n**Definition:**\n- Terminal position (no moves): Grundy number = 0\n- Any position: Grundy number = MEX of all positions you can move to\n\n**MEX** = Minimal Excludant = smallest non-negative integer not in the set\n\n**Example:**\n- Moves lead to positions with nimbers {0, 1, 3}\n- MEX({0, 1, 3}) = 2\n- This position has nimber 2\n\n:::hint[MEX Examples]\n- MEX({1, 2, 3}) = 0\n- MEX({0, 2, 3}) = 1\n- MEX({0, 1, 2}) = 3\n- MEX({}) = 0\n:::\n\n### Why Nimbers Matter\n\n**The key insight:** Compound games (multiple independent games played simultaneously) can be analyzed by XORing their nimbers!\n\n**Theorem:** If you play multiple independent games simultaneously:\n- Game A has nimber a\n- Game B has nimber b\n- The combined game has nimber a ⊕ b\n\n**Position is P-position ⟺ nimber = 0**\n\n## Example: The Game of Chomp\n\n::::puzzle\n**Chomp**\n\nA 3×5 rectangular chocolate bar. Bottom-left square is poisoned.\n\nPlayers take turns choosing a square and removing it along with all squares above and to the right.\n\nThe player forced to take the poisoned square loses.\n\nWho wins with optimal play?\n\n:::hint\nThis is a strategy-stealing argument. Think about symmetry.\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Strategy-stealing proof:**\n\n**Claim:** The first player wins.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nSuppose (for contradiction) that the second player has a winning strategy.\n\nFirst player's move: Remove the top-right corner square.\n\nNow the board is nearly unchanged—just missing one corner square. If second player had a winning strategy from the start, they should still have a winning strategy now.\n\nBut wait—if second player's \"winning strategy\" was to remove the top-right corner as their first move, they can't do that anymore (it's already gone).

For general rectangular boards, the optimal strategy is unknown!\n:::\n::::\n\n## Misère Games\n\nIn **misère play**, the player who makes the last move **loses** (instead of wins).\n\n**How does this change things?**\n\nFor Nim in misère play:\n- **P-positions:** XOR = 0, OR all piles have size ≤ 1 and there's an odd number of piles\n- Strategy becomes more complex near the endgame\n\n:::hint\nMany CGT results for normal play have misère variants with slightly modified rules.

Players can remove 1, 2, or 3 objects. Last player to move wins.\n\n**Grundy numbers:**\n- G(0) = 0 (no moves)\n- G(1) = MEX{G(0)} = MEX{0} = 1\n- G(2) = MEX{G(1), G(0)} = MEX{1, 0} = 2\n- G(3) = MEX{G(2), G(1), G(0)} = MEX{2, 1, 0} = 3\n- G(4) = MEX{G(3), G(2), G(1)} = MEX{3, 2, 1} = 0\n- G(5) = MEX{G(4), G(3), G(2)} = MEX{0, 3, 2} = 1\n\n**Pattern:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
