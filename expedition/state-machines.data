Understanding **state machines** and **information encoding** is crucial for solving these dynamic puzzles.\n\n## What Is a State?\n\nA **state** is a snapshot of the puzzle at a particular moment.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Chess: Position of all pieces on the board\n- River crossing puzzle: Which items are on which bank\n- Light switch puzzle: Which switches are on/off, which bulbs are on/off\n\n## State Transitions\n\nA **transition** is a move from one state to another, usually by taking an action.\n\n**Example** (Light switches):\n- State 1: [OFF, OFF, OFF]\n- Action: Flip switch 2\n- State 2: [OFF, ON, OFF]\n\n## Why State Machines Matter\n\nMany classic puzzles involve:\n- **Sequential decision-making** - Each move changes the state\n- **Limited information** - You can't see everything\n- **Irreversible actions** - Some moves can't be undone\n- **Goal states** - You need to reach a specific final state\n\n:::hint\nWhen facing a sequential puzzle, ask: \"What are all possible states?\" and \"What transitions are allowed?\"\n:::\n\n## Information Encoding\n\nA powerful technique is using states to **encode information**.\n\n### The Light Bulb Encoding Trick\n\nRemember the three-switch puzzle from Introduction to Logic?\n\nThe key insight: A light bulb has THREE distinguishable states:\n1. On\n2. Off and warm\n3. Off and cold\n\nEven though you can only control two values (on/off), the bulb can encode three states by using **time and heat**!\n\n::::puzzle\n**The 100 Prisoners Problem** (Simplified)\n\n100 prisoners are given a challenge. There's a room with a single light switch. Prisoners will be brought to the room one at a time in random order (possibly repeating). They can flip the switch or leave it. They cannot communicate except through the switch.\n\nOne prisoner (any prisoner) must eventually declare: \"All 100 prisoners have visited the room at least once.\" If correct, they all go free. If wrong, they all remain imprisoned.\n\nHow can they guarantee success?\n\n:::hint\nCan one prisoner act as a \"counter\"? How would others signal to the counter?\n:::\n\n:::hint[Information Encoding]\nThink about what the switch position means. Can prisoners use the switch to send a signal?\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Strategy:**\n\n**Setup** (all prisoners agree beforehand):\n- Designate one prisoner as the \"Counter\"\n- All other prisoners are \"Reporters\"\n\n**Reporter strategy:**\n- If you enter and the light is OFF, and you haven't flipped it ON before, flip it ON\n- Otherwise, do nothing\n- Remember that you've flipped the switch\n\n**Counter strategy:**\n- Count how many times you find the light ON\n- Each time you find it ON, flip it OFF and increment your count\n- When your count reaches 99, declare \"All 100 prisoners have visited\"\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Each Reporter flips the switch ON exactly once (the first time they visit)\n- The Counter counts these signals\n- 99 reporters + 1 counter = 100 prisoners\n- The switch encodes information: ON = \"a new prisoner has visited since the Counter last checked\"\n\nThis can take a very long time (possibly thousands of visits), but it's guaranteed to eventually succeed!\n:::\n::::\n\n## State Space Exploration\n\nFor some puzzles, you need to explore the **state space**—all possible states and transitions.\n\n### Example: Water Jug Puzzle\n\n::::puzzle\n**The Water Jug Puzzle**\n\nYou have two jugs:\n- Jug A: Holds 5 liters\n- Jug B: Holds 3 liters\n\nYou have an unlimited water supply. You can:\n- Fill a jug completely\n- Empty a jug completely\n- Pour from one jug to another (stop when source is empty or destination is full)\n\n**Goal:** Measure exactly 4 liters in Jug A.\n\n:::hint\nThink of states as (A, B) where A and B are the current amounts. What's your starting state? What's your goal state?\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**State representation:** (A, B) = (liters in Jug A, liters in Jug B)\n\n**Starting state:** (0, 0)\n**Goal state:** (4, ?)\n\n**Solution path:**\n1. (0, 0) - Start\n2. (5, 0) - Fill Jug A\n3. (2, 3) - Pour A into B until B is full\n4. (2, 0) - Empty B\n5. (0, 2) - Pour A into B\n6. (5, 2) - Fill A\n7. (4, 3) - Pour A into B until B is full\n\n**Final state:** (4, 3) ✓\n\nThis works because we systematically explored state transitions to find a path from start to goal!\n:::\n::::\n\n## Thinking in States\n\nTo solve state-based puzzles:\n\n1. **Define states clearly** - What information matters?\n2. **Identify legal transitions** - What actions are allowed?\n3. **Find invariants** - What stays constant across transitions?\n4. **Look for cycles** - Do any states repeat?\n5. **Work backwards** - Start from the goal and work back to the start\n\n:::hint[Invariants]\nAn **invariant** is something that doesn't change. Example: In the water jug puzzle, the total amount of water can only be 0, 3, 5, or 8 liters. This constrains possible states!\n:::\n\n## Information Theory in Puzzles\n\nSometimes you need to think about **how much information** a state can encode.\n\n**Key concepts:**\n- **Bits of information**: How many yes/no questions can you answer?\n- **Distinguishable states**: How many different states can you create?\n- **Information capacity**: What's the maximum information you can encode?\n\n### Example: The Hat Puzzle\n\n::::puzzle\n**The Hat Puzzle**\n\nThree prisoners are given a challenge. Each will wear either a red or blue hat (random). Each can see the others' hats but not their own.\n\nThey must simultaneously (no communication!) either guess their hat color or pass.
