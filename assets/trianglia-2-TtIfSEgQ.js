When the Prince of Trianglia (an island where all intersections are Ys, and no roads lead to dead ends) returned from his voyage of discovery, he issued two edicts:

Because he spent a month trapped by a washed-out road, new roads are to be built so that there is more than one route to every portion of Trianglia.

Because dirt roads are tiresome and boring, all roads will be paved with either red, yellow, or blue bricks (each road having only one color). The color of each road should be chosen so that every intersection is the meeting of roads of all three colors.

Can the Trianglians assign a color to each of the roads to satisfy the second edict? If so, how?
