An aging sheikh, nearing the end of his life, decides to leave his vast fortune to one of his two sons.

Confused by the unusual rule, the brothers begin the race but quickly realise that neither wants to cross the finish line first. They both wander the desert for days, each trying to avoid winning.

Suddenly, the brothers leap onto their camels and race toward the finish line at full speed.

What did he tell them?
