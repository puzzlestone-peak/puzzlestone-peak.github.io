# The Conjecture

**Goldbach's Conjecture (1742)**: Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

**Examples**:
- 4 = 2 + 2
- 6 = 3 + 3
- 8 = 3 + 5
- 10 = 3 + 7 = 5 + 5
- 12 = 5 + 7
- 100 = 3 + 97 = 11 + 89 = 17 + 83 = 29 + 71 = 41 + 59 = 47 + 53

As numbers grow larger, there are typically **many** ways to express them as sums of two primes.

# Historical Context

In 1742, Christian Goldbach wrote to Leonhard Euler proposing this conjecture. Euler became interested but couldn't prove it. Neither has anyone else in the subsequent **282 years**.

# The Research Challenge

This is an **open research problem**. A proof would be a major breakthrough in number theory.

**Verification**: The conjecture has been verified computationally for all even integers up to $4 \\times 10^{18}$ (as of 2025). Yet no proof exists for all numbers.

**Your challenge**: Explore the conjecture through these investigations:

**Part A**: For the first 20 even numbers (4 through 42), find all representations as sums of two primes. Do you notice any patterns in the number of representations?

**Part B**: Define r(n) as the number of ways to write even n as a sum of two primes (counting order as insignificant). Compute r(n) for n = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. Does r(n) tend to increase with n?

**Part C**: Research the **weak Goldbach conjecture** (three primes). What was its status, and how does it relate to the strong conjecture?

**Part D**: Study Vinogradov's theorem (1937) and Chen's theorem (1973). What did each prove, and why are these considered "near misses" rather than solutions?

**Part E**: Propose an approach to proving Goldbach's conjecture. What makes this problem so difficult despite its simple statement?

:::hint
For Part A and B, systematic computation is needed. Look for patterns in how r(n) grows.
:::

:::hint
For Part C, the weak conjecture concerns odd numbers and sums of three primes. It was proved in 2013.
:::

:::hint
For Part D, both theorems prove weaker statements that are "close" to Goldbach. Understanding why they fall short illuminates the difficulty.
:::

:::hint
For Part E, consider why techniques that work for related problems (like Waring's problem) don't extend to Goldbach. The requirement that summands be prime is crucial.
:::

:::solution
**Answer**: This problem is unsolved. Below are investigations, known results, and why it remains open.

## Part A: Small Even Numbers

Representations as sums of two primes:

- 4 = 2+2 (1 way)
- 6 = 3+3 (1 way)
- 8 = 3+5 (1 way)
- 10 = 3+7, 5+5 (2 ways)
- 12 = 5+7 (1 way)
- 14 = 3+11, 7+7 (2 ways)
- 16 = 3+13, 5+11 (2 ways)
- 18 = 5+13, 7+11 (2 ways)
- 20 = 3+17, 7+13 (2 ways)
- 22 = 3+19, 5+17, 11+11 (3 ways)
- 24 = 5+19, 7+17, 11+13 (3 ways)
- 26 = 3+23, 7+19, 13+13 (3 ways)
- 28 = 5+23, 11+17 (2 ways)
- 30 = 7+23, 11+19, 13+17 (3 ways)
- 32 = 3+29, 13+19 (2 ways)
- 34 = 3+31, 5+29, 11+23, 17+17 (4 ways)
- 36 = 5+31, 7+29, 13+23, 17+19 (4 ways)
- 38 = 7+31, 19+19 (2 ways)
- 40 = 3+37, 11+29, 17+23 (3 ways)
- 42 = 5+37, 11+31, 13+29, 19+23 (4 ways)

**Patterns**: The number of representations fluctuates but tends to increase for larger numbers.

## Part B: Counting Representations

Computing r(n) for selected values:

- r(10) = 2
- r(20) = 2
- r(30) = 3
- r(40) = 3
- r(50) = 4 (3+47, 7+43, 13+37, 19+31)
- r(100) = 6
- r(1000) = 28
- r(10000) = 327

**Hardy-Littlewood conjecture**: For large even n,
$$r(n) \\sim 2C_2 \\frac{n}{(\\ln n)^2} \\prod_{p|n, p>2} \\frac{p-1}{p-2}$$

where $C_2 \\approx 0.66$ is the twin prime constant.

This predicts r(n) grows roughly as $n/(\\ln n)^2$, meaning larger numbers have more representations. Computational evidence strongly supports this.

## Part C: Weak Goldbach Conjecture

The **weak Goldbach conjecture** (also called the ternary Goldbach conjecture) states:

**Every odd integer greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three odd primes.**

Examples:
- 7 = 2+2+3 (but 2+2+3 uses 2, so better: 7 = 3+2+2)
- 9 = 3+3+3
- 11 = 3+3+5
- 13 = 3+5+5

**Status**: The weak conjecture was **proven** by Harald Helfgott in 2013 (with additional work published through 2015).

**Relationship**: If the strong Goldbach conjecture is true, the weak conjecture follows immediately:
- Let n be an odd number > 5
- Then n - 3 is even and > 2
- By strong Goldbach: n - 3 = p + q for primes p, q
- Therefore: n = 3 + p + q ✓

The converse doesn't hold — weak doesn't imply strong.

## Part D: Near Misses

**Vinogradov's Theorem (1937)**:

Every sufficiently large odd integer can be expressed as the sum of three odd primes.

"Sufficiently large" means there exists some N such that for all odd n > N, the property holds. Vinogradov didn't compute N explicitly, but later work showed it's enormously large (roughly $e^{e^{16.038}}$).

**Why it's a near miss**: It proves the weak conjecture for large numbers but doesn't cover all odd numbers. Helfgott's work extended this to all odd numbers > 5.

**Chen's Theorem (1973)**:

Every sufficiently large even integer can be expressed as either:
- The sum of two primes, OR
- The sum of a prime and a **semiprime** (product of two primes)

**Why it's a near miss**: This is tantalizingly close to Goldbach! It proves every large even number is p + q where q is "almost prime" (at most two prime factors). But Goldbach requires q to be actually prime, not semiprime.

Chen's theorem shows the conjecture is "almost true" — the second summand has at most two prime factors instead of exactly one.

## Part E: Why It's So Hard

**Simplicity of statement**: A child can understand it. Yet the proof eludes us.

**Why existing techniques fail**:

1. **Additive vs multiplicative**: Primes are defined multiplicatively (can't be factored) but Goldbach is an additive question (sums). Our tools work best for one or the other, not both.

2. **Distribution irregularity**: Primes are irregularly distributed. We understand their global density (Prime Number Theorem) but not local patterns well enough.

3. **No obvious structural approach**: Unlike Fermat's Last Theorem (which connected to elliptic curves, modular forms), Goldbach doesn't obviously embed into a richer structure.

4. **All or nothing**: Techniques like Chen's and Vinogradov's get "close" but crossing the final gap seems to require fundamentally new ideas.

**Proposed approaches**:

- **Circle method** (Hardy-Littlewood): Powerful but not quite strong enough
- **Sieve theory** (Chen, Brun): Gets close but can't eliminate all composite summands
- **Probabilistic methods**: Primes behave "randomly enough" that heuristics suggest Goldbach holds, but making this rigorous is the challenge
- **Connections to L-functions**: Perhaps deeper understanding of Dirichlet L-functions and GRH could help

**Current status**: Most mathematicians believe Goldbach's conjecture is true. The computational evidence is overwhelming. But belief isn't proof.

## For the Ambitious Solver

If you're interested in exploring this problem:

1. **Study analytic number theory**: Circle method, sieve theory, exponential sums
2. **Understand prime distribution**: Prime Number Theorem, Riemann Hypothesis
3. **Explore partial results**: Chen's theorem proof is instructive
4. **Develop new techniques**: The solution likely requires ideas we haven't discovered yet

A proof of Goldbach's conjecture would be a monumental achievement, advancing our understanding of the mysterious distribution of prime numbers.

**Prize**: While no formal prize is offered, solving Goldbach would guarantee mathematical immortality and likely a Fields Medal (if under 40).
