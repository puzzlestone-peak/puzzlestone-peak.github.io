<p>In WitNoTB?, Smullyan introduces his Knights, Knaves, and Normals. Knights always tell the truth, Knaves always lie, and Normals can do either. In the subchapter titled "How to Marry a King's Daughter", Smullyan tells the story of a king who wants his daughter to marry a nice normal Normal, not one of those goody-goody Knights or devious scoundrel Knaves.

<li>How can you make a true statement that will convince the King you are a Normal?</li>
<li>How can you make a false statement that will convince the King you are a Normal?</li>
<li>How can you make a statement that will convince the King you are a Normal, but he won't know whether it's true or false?</li>
</ul>
<p>Then Smullyan tells the story of a different King, one who is not so kindly disposed towards Normals. In fact, he sees them as wishy-washy girly-men, unreliable and untrustworthy. A Knight will always be true, and a Knave is wholly reliable as long as you remember to believe the exact opposite of what he says, while a Normal will deceive you when you least expect it. He wants his daughter to marry anyone but a Normal. Smullyan asks: how many statements must you make to convince the King?</p>
<p>Smullyan's answer was: no statements you make can ever convince the King you are no Normal. Since a Normal can say anything, any statement you make could be made by a Normal. There is no way to prove your abnormality to the King.</p>

( From Raymond Smullyan's book What is the Name of This Book? )

In WitNoTB?, Smullyan introduces his Knights, Knaves, and Normals. Knights always tell the truth, Knaves always lie, and Normals can do either. In the subchapter titled "How to Marry a King's Daughter", Smullyan tells the story of a king who wants his daughter to marry a nice normal Normal, not one of those goody-goody Knights or devious scoundrel Knaves. Smullyan asks the following questions (easy puzzles):

* How can you make a true statement that will convince the King you are a Normal?  
* How can you make a false statement that will convince the King you are a Normal?  
* How can you make a statement that will convince the King you are a Normal, but he won't know whether it's true or false?

Then Smullyan tells the story of a different King, one who is not so kindly disposed towards Normals. In fact, he sees them as wishy-washy girly-men, unreliable and untrustworthy. A Knight will always be true, and a Knave is wholly reliable as long as you remember to believe the exact opposite of what he says, while a Normal will deceive you when you least expect it. He wants his daughter to marry anyone but a Normal. Smullyan asks: how many statements must you make to convince the King?

Smullyan's answer was: no statements you make can ever convince the King you are no Normal. Since a Normal can say anything, any statement you make could be made by a Normal. There is no way to prove your abnormality to the King.

Smullyan was wrong! There is a subtle flaw in his argument, and in fact it is quite possible for a non-Normal to prove it. So the puzzle for you is (harder puzzles):

* How can you, in one statement, convince the King you are a Knight?  
* How can you, in one statement, convince the King you are a Knave?  
* How can you, in one statement, convince the King you are not a Normal, but leave him unable to deduce whether you are a Knight or a Knave?
