<p>You’re given a 10x10 chessboard. You can place 3+1 L-shaped pieces on the board, with each one covering exactly 4 tiles. These pieces can be rotated by 90° increments or flipped, but cannot be overlapped. Can you cover the entire chessboard? If yes, show an arrangement of such a covering. If not, prove why it cannot be done.</p>

<p>Colour every alternating row black and white. Note that every L piece will cover either 3 black tiles and 1 white tile, or 1 black tile and 3 white tiles.

It cannot be done.

Colour every alternating row black and white. Note that every L piece will cover either 3 black tiles and 1 white tile, or 1 black tile and 3 white tiles. Since there are an equal number of black and white tiles, the number of L pieces covering 3 black tiles and 1 white tile must be equal to the number of L pieces covering 1 black tile and 3 white tiles.

However, we will need 25 L pieces to cover this board, which is an odd number. Therefore, the two types of tiles can never be equal, and we can never cover the chessboard.
