You’re making the perfect soft-boiled eggs: all you have to do is boil eggs in a pot of water for exactly 9 minutes. However, your kitchen timer is broken, and all you have are two hourglasses: one measures 4 minutes, the other measures 7 minutes. Using only these two hourglasses, how can you measure exactly 9 minutes?
