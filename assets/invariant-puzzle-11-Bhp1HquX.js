<p>Setup: A circular sheet is divided into six sectors and placed on a table. A chess piece is placed on each sector. The objective is to get all the pieces on the same sector. The only allowed operation is to take any two pieces and move each of them to any of their respective adjacent sectors. Idea: The objective cannot be attained. The alternating sum of number of pieces on alternate sectors always leaves a reminder 0 when divided by 4.</p>`,rawContent:`<!-- Difficulty: \\[todo\\] -->

Setup: A circular sheet is divided into six sectors and placed on a table. A chess piece is placed on each sector. The objective is to get all the pieces on the same sector. The only allowed operation is to take any two pieces and move each of them to any of their respective adjacent sectors. Idea: The objective cannot be attained. The alternating sum of number of pieces on alternate sectors always leaves a reminder 0 when divided by 4.
