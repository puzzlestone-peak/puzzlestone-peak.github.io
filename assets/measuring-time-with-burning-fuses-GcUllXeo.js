<p>You’re breaking into a high-security vault to steal a valuable gem. After using explosives to blow up multiple doorways to gain entry, you finally crack the combination to enter the safe room. You’re about to grab the gem and escape when someone triggers the vault’s lockdown mode. Alarms blare, and the safe room’s steel door slams shut, sealing you in.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you’ve done your research. You know the door has an emergency escape mechanism: a button hidden behind one of its panels. To release the door, you have to press the button twice, exactly 3 minutes apart. A second too early or late, and the door will not open until the authorities arrive.</p>

You’re breaking into a high-security vault to steal a valuable gem. After using explosives to blow up multiple doorways to gain entry, you finally crack the combination to enter the safe room. You’re about to grab the gem and escape when someone triggers the vault’s lockdown mode. Alarms blare, and the safe room’s steel door slams shut, sealing you in.

Thankfully, you’ve done your research. You know the door has an emergency escape mechanism: a button hidden behind one of its panels. To release the door, you have to press the button twice, exactly 3 minutes apart. A second too early or late, and the door will not open until the authorities arrive.

While you don’t have any timekeeping devices on you, you do have a lighter and 2 fuses left over from your explosives. Each fuse takes 4 minutes to burn through completely. However, they burn unevenly, meaning that even if you cut a fuse into two equal parts, they don’t necessarily have to burn for the same amount of time (e.g. the 2 parts could take 1 minute and 3 minutes to burn through respectively).

How can you measure out 3 minutes of time with the fuses in order to escape?

:::hint
There are no tricks to this. You can actually measure out 3 minutes of time by burning the fuses.

Hmm… if you burnt a fuse from both ends, how long will it take for it to fully burn through?
