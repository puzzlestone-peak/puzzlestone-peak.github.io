# The Liar's Paradox

Consider this statement:

> "This statement is false."

Let's try to determine whether it's true or false:
- If the statement is **true**, then what it says must be correct, meaning it is **false**
- If the statement is **false**, then what it says must be incorrect, meaning it is **true**

# The Question

Is this statement true or false? How can we resolve this paradox?

:::hint
The issue arises from self-reference. The statement refers to itself.
:::

:::hint[Breaking the Rules]
What assumptions about truth and falsity does this paradox violate?
:::

:::solution
**Answer**: The statement is neither true nor false — it's a paradox that reveals limitations in our logical systems.

This is called the **Liar's Paradox**, one of the oldest logical paradoxes, dating back to ancient Greek philosophy.

The paradox arises because:
1. The statement refers to itself (self-reference)
2. This self-reference creates a logical loop
3. Our binary system (true/false) can't handle this loop

## Philosophical Implications

Different schools of thought handle this differently:

**Classical logic**: Declares such statements "meaningless" or "ill-formed" — not every grammatically correct sentence has a truth value.

**Paraconsistent logic**: Allows statements to be both true and false simultaneously, avoiding the contradiction.

**Tarski's hierarchy**: Proposes that statements about truth must be in a "meta-language" above the object language, preventing self-reference.

## Everyday Examples

Similar paradoxes appear in everyday situations:
- "I always lie" (if true, then false; if false, then true)
- "This sentence has five words" (true, but only contingently)
- "I am now lying" (creates the same loop)
