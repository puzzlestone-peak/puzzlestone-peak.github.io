A man is looking at a photograph of someone. His friend asks who it is.

The man replies, “Brothers and sisters, I have none. But that man’s father is my father’s son.”

Who is in the photograph?

:::solution
**Answer**: The photograph is of the man’s son.

Since the man has no brothers or sisters, “my father’s son” must refer to himself.

Thus, “that man’s father is my father’s son” means “that man’s father is me”.

The photograph is of his son.
