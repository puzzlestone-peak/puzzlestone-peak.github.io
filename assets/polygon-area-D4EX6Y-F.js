Given a bunch of (x,y) coordinates that form the vertices of one non-self-intersecting polygon, how would you go about finding the area of that polygon? What is the most clever / elegant solution you can devise? The desired answer is remarkably simple.

Note: Notice I did not say the polygon has to be regular or convex. A regular polygon has all sides of equal length. A convex polygon is a polygon such that all line segments formed between any two vertices must lie inside the polygon boundaries.
