An acrobat thief enters an ancient temple, and finds the following scenario:

* The roof of the temple is 100 meters high.  
* In the roof there are two holes, separated by 1 meter.  
* Through each hole passes a single gold rope, each going all the way to the floor.  
* There is nothing else in the room.  
* The thief would like to cut and steal as much of the ropes as he can. However, he knows that if he falls from height that is greater than 10 meters, he will die. The only thing in his possession is a knife.

How much length of rope can the acrobat thief get? And how?

(Decro: do we need to get additional rules? E.g. you can tie rope parts together, etc)
