<p>"How long of a head start do you need?" asked Achilles, smiling.<br>

"Very quickly," Achilles affirmed.<br>
"And in that time, how far should I have gone, do you think?"<br>
"Perhaps a meter - no more," said Achilles after a moment's thought.<br>
"Very well," replied the Tortoise, "so now there is a meter between us. And you would catch up that distance very quickly?"<br>
"Very quickly indeed!"<br>
"And yet, in that time I shall have gone a little way farther, so that now you must catch that distance up, yes?"<br>
"Ye-es," said Achilles slowly.<br>
"And while you are doing so, I shall have gone a little way farther, so that you must then catch up the new distance," the Tortoise continued smoothly.<br>
Achilles said nothing.<br>
"And so you see, in each moment you must be catching up the distance between us, and yet I - at the same time - will be adding a new distance, however small, for you to catch up again."<br>

The Tortoise challenged the great warrior Achilles to a 100 meter foot race, claiming that he would win as long as Achilles granted him a little headstart. Achilles laughed, for he was a mighty warrior swift of foot, whereas the Tortoise was heavy and slow.
