# The Theorem

**Four Colour Theorem**: Every planar graph can be coloured with at most four colours such that no two adjacent vertices share the same colour.

# The History

**1852**: Francis Guthrie conjectures the theorem while colouring a map of England.

**1879**: Alfred Kempe publishes a "proof" that stands for 11 years.

**1890**: Percy Heawood finds an error in Kempe's proof, but proves that **five colours suffice** (an easier result).

**1976**: Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken prove the theorem using a computer, checking 1,936 special cases (later reduced to 633).

**1996**: Robertson, Sanders, Seymour, and Thomas provide a simpler proof, still computer-assisted.

# The Question

Why was this theorem so hard to prove? And why is the proof considered controversial?

:::hint
The proof uses a technique called "discharging" combined with exhaustive computer verification.
:::

:::hint[Irreducible Configurations]
The proof identifies "unavoidable" configurations that must appear in every planar graph, then shows each can be 4-coloured.
:::

:::solution
**Answer**: The theorem was proven by showing that certain configurations must appear in every planar graph, then using computers to verify that each can be 4-coloured.

## Why It Was Hard

### 1. Enormous Case Analysis

Unlike most mathematical proofs, this one couldn't be reduced to a simple logical argument. The proof required checking thousands of special cases.

### 2. Human Verification Impossible

The number of cases was too large for humans to verify by hand. This was unprecedented in mathematics.

### 3. Complex Interactions

Planar graphs have intricate local structures that can interact in subtle ways. General techniques failed to capture all cases.

## The Proof Strategy

### Phase 1: Unavoidable Set

Prove that every planar graph must contain at least one configuration from a specific set of configurations.

**Technique**: "Discharging algorithm"
- Assign initial charges to vertices based on degree
- Redistribute charges according to specific rules
- Show that some configuration must have negative charge

This part used Euler's formula: $V - E + F = 2$ for connected planar graphs.

### Phase 2: Reducible Configurations

Show that each configuration in the unavoidable set is "reducible" — if you can 4-colour a smaller graph, you can extend the colouring to include the configuration.

**Technique**: Kempe chains
- Special chains of alternating colours
- Can be flipped to free up colours
- Computer verification of all cases

### Phase 3: Computer Verification

Use computers to check that:
1. The unavoidable set is indeed unavoidable
2. Each configuration is reducible

This required checking 1,936 cases (later optimized to 633).

## Why It's Controversial

### Arguments Against Computer-Assisted Proofs

**1. Not Surveyable**: No human can verify the entire proof by reading it.

**2. Software Bugs**: Computers can have bugs. How do we know the verification program was correct?

**3. Not Elegant**: Mathematics values elegant, insight-providing proofs. This proof is a brute-force case analysis.

**4. Not Explanatory**: The proof doesn't explain *why* four colours suffice — it just shows that they do.

### Arguments For Computer-Assisted Proofs

**1. Reliable**: Properly written software can be more reliable than human checking.

**2. Necessary**: Some theorems may require case analysis beyond human capacity.

**3. Verifiable**: The proof has been independently verified by multiple teams using different programs.

**4. Progress**: This opened the door to computer-assisted mathematics, now a thriving field.

## Modern Developments

**2005**: Georges Gonthier formally verified the proof using the Coq proof assistant, providing mathematical certainty about the proof's correctness.

This formal verification:
- Uses computer-checkable formal logic
- Provides machine-verified correctness
- Addresses concerns about software bugs
- Represents over 60,000 lines of proof code

## Philosophical Questions

**Is it really a proof?** Most mathematicians now accept it, but debates continue about:
- What constitutes understanding in mathematics
- The role of computational methods in pure mathematics
- Whether insight or correctness is more important

**The nature of mathematical knowledge**: Does this proof provide knowledge even though no human understands every detail?

## Related Open Problems

**Hadwiger Conjecture**: Generalizes the Four Colour Theorem to arbitrary graphs. States that every graph with no $K_n$ minor is $(n-1)$-colourable. Proven for $n \\leq 6$, open for $n \\geq 7$.

**Complexity**: Although we know 4 colours suffice, determining if 3 colours suffice for a given planar graph is NP-complete!

## The Bigger Picture

The Four Colour Theorem represents a turning point in mathematics:
- First major theorem requiring computers
- Sparked debate about the nature of proof
- Led to the development of formal verification
- Changed how mathematicians think about proof and certainty

Whether you view it as a triumph of computational mathematics or a brute-force sledgehammer, it remains one of the most significant theorems in graph theory.
