# The Scenario

You find yourself trapped in a dungeon with two doors before you:
- One door leads to **freedom**
- One door leads to **certain doom**

Two guards stand watch:
- One guard **always tells the truth**
- One guard **always lies**

You don't know which guard is which.

# The Challenge

You may ask **one guard** **one question** to determine which door leads to freedom.

What question do you ask?

:::hint
Think about what happens when you ask one guard about what the other guard would say.
:::

:::hint[A More Specific Hint]
If you ask the truth-teller what the liar would say, they'll tell you the truth about the liar's lie. If you ask the liar what the truth-teller would say, they'll lie about the truth.
:::

:::solution
Ask either guard: "If I asked the other guard which door leads to freedom, which door would they point to?"

Both guards will point to the **door of doom**:
- The truth-teller will honestly tell you that the liar would point to the door of doom
- The liar will lie about the truth-teller's answer and also point to the door of doom

Therefore, choose the **opposite door** from the one they indicate.
:::

:::solution[Alternative Solution]
You could also ask: "Which door would you point to if I asked you which door leads to freedom?"

This works because:
- The truth-teller would point to the correct door (freedom)
- The liar would lie about their own lie, creating a double negative that also points to freedom

Both guards point to the same door—the door to freedom!
