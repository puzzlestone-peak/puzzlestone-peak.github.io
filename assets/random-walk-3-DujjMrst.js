Imagine an upright ladder with n rungs. At each time step, a frog jumps to one of the n rungs uniformly at random. (The frog could jump in place.) Assume time starts counting from 1, and the initial rung position is also chosen uniformly at random.

As the number of rungs tends to infinity, what is the expected time till the frog first jumps downwards? Prove it.

Adapt this to a random walk, but he teleports?
