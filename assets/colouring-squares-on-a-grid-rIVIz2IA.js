You're playing a game with your friend on an infinitely large piece of graph paper. You and a friend each have a different color pen. You take turns marking intersections of the grid. The winner is the first person to color 4 intersections that form a square. The square may be of any size, but it must be oriented in the direction of the grid; that is, something like the midpoints of each side of a 2x2 square won't qualify.

What is the optimal strategy for each player?
