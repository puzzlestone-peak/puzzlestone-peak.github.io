<p>There are three omniscient gods sitting in a chamber: AND, OR, and XOR. They all answer the truth, but they all apply their namesake operations in one of the following ways:</p>
<p>BACKWARD: The operator is applied to ALL of the questions that have been asked THUS FAR.<br>
UNIVERSAL: The operator is applied to ALL of the questions (you have to pick your questions beforehand).<br>
SELFLESS: The operator is applied to ALL of the questions NOT asked to them (you pick your questions beforehand).<br>
For each of the 3 cases, determine with proof the minimum number of questions that will allow you to identify which god is which.</p>
<p>Note 1: (Standard; rules that are generally assumed unless otherwise noted.) The gods only answer yes/no questions. Each god answers in the single word of their language as appropriate to the question; i.e. each god always gives one of only two possible responses, one affirmative and one negative (e.g. they would always answer "Yes" rather than "That would be true"). Each question asked must be addressed to a single specific god; asking one question to all the gods would constitute three questions. Asking a single god multiple questions is permissible. The question you choose to ask and the god you choose to address may be dynamically chosen based on the answers to previous questions.</p>
