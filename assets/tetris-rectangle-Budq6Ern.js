With these pieces, can you form a rectangle or a square without forming gaps or overlapping squares? If yes, show a way that it can be done. If no, prove why not.

It is impossible to do so.

There are 7 tetrominos, each having an area of 4 squares. Therefore, the final rectangle must have an area of 7 * 4 = 28 squares. If we look at the possible factorisations of 28, we get possible rectangles of 1x28, 2x14, and 4x7. Let’s show these rectangles and colour them like
