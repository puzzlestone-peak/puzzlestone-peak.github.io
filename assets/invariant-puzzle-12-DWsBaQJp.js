Setup: This is a game between two players. In the first version of the game, 12 pennies are placed in a circle on a table. Players alternate in removing one penny or two adjacent pennies.

Whoever removes the last penny wins the game. In the second version of the game, there are 11 pennies instead of 12. Idea: Player two can always win the game. In the first version of the game, player 2 can symmetrically mimic player 1. In the second version of the game, player 2 will remove one penny in the first move if player 1 had removed two pennies and vice versa. The first move for player 2 is at the diametrically opposite side of the circle as player 1’s first move. For the rest of the game, player two can symmetrically mimic player 1.
