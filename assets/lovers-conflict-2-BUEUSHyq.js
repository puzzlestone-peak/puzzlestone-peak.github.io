In the Hemlock Grove retirement villa, four seniors are discovering the joys and sorrows of a "love square". Amelia, Bertrand, Claire, and Donald have gotten themselves mixed up in a little more than they can handle.

Amelia has fallen for Bertrand, with his youthfully craggy face and his deep gravely voice. Bertrand does not realize this, and secretly admires Claire, with her youthful temperament and derring-do. Claire is oblivious to Bertrand's feelings, and is instead obsessed with Donald and his mysterious past. Donald doesn't know that Claire is interested in him, but he has the hots for Amelia.

Of course, Bertrand realizes that Claire likes Donald, and has secretly vowed to get Donald on the bad side of the cleaning staff. Donald shares Bertrand's emnity, since his beloved Amelia is bewitched by the old git. He has been trying to get a bird to build its nest over top of Bertrand's patio door for nearly a year now.

Amelia recognizes the glint in Bertrand's eye when he looks at Claire, and she is determined to sabotage Claire's next candlelight supper by replacing her baking powder with powdered salt. Claire is likewise jealous of Amelia, that slut, and she plans to run her over on the sidewalk with her electric three-wheeled buggy.

One day, you meet all four of these unhappy individuals in a chat room, going under the nicknames UsUxOrZ, VampireBob, WussMania, and Xanadu. Because they are all slightly crazy (they are in love after all), each person will only answer a question correctly if:

one of your last two questions was asked of their sweetheart, and  
your last question was not to their enemy.  
Otherwise, they will tell you whatever they feel like telling you. Is there any way that you can deduce the identities of these four individuals? How many questions must you ask to determine who is who?
