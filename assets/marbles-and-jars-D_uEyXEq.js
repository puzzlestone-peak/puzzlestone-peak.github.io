Two jars contain the same total numbers of marbles, some blacks and some whites in each. From each jar are drawn n marbles with replacement, where n >= 3. Find the number of drawings and the composition of the two jars so that the probability that all white marbles are drawn from the first urn is equal to the probability that the drawing from the second is either all whites or all blacks.
