Do you agree with the following inductive proof? Clearly explain why or why not.

Theorem: All horses are the same color.

Base Case: 1 horse. Clearly with just 1 horse, all horses have the same color.

Inductive Step: If it is true for any group of N horses that all have the same color, then it is true for any group of N+1 horses. Given any set of N+1 horses, if you exclude a random horse, you get a set of N horses. By the inductive step these N horses all have the same color. But by excluding any other horse in the pack of N+1 horses, you can conclude that the last N horses also have the same color. Therefore all N+1 horses have the same color. QED.
