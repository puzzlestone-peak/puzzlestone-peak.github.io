Setup: A circle is drawn on the board and divided into six sectors. The numbers 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 are written on them in this order. The objective is to get all the numbers to be the same. The only allowed operation is to add one to any two adjacent sectors. Idea: Alternating sum of alternate sectors (i.e. 1 − 0 + 1 − 0 + 0 = 2\\) is a constant.
