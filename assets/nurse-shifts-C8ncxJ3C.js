All patients at the d'Oralian National Hospital require constant care. At least one nurse must be beside a patient's bed at any time and a nurse can only care for one patient simultaneously.

The nurses won't work more that eight hours within any 24 hour period, but don't care when their shift starts. Their shifts look like this: work five hours, one hour break, work another three hours.

How many nurses do you need for one patient? How many nurses do you need for n patients?
