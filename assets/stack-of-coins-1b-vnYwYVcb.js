Choose to go first and take 1 coin. After that, when your friend makes a move, take $11 - x$ coins, where $x$ is the number of coins he took.

:::note[Recapping the solution for Stack of Coins 1A]

The trick to [Stack of Coins 1A](puzzle:stack-of-coins-1a) is to notice that you always want to reduce the stack of coins by 3. 3 coins is the perfect number because:
- Your friend cannot remove 3 coins at once on his turn
- After your friend’s turn (taking 1 or 2 coins), you can always make a move (taking 2 or 1 coins) such that you both reduce the stack by 3 coins.

This ensures you can always keep the stack at a multiple of 3, until the number of coins reaches 0 (which is also a multiple of 3). But since you will be the last to move for every group of 3 coins, you will be the player to bring the number of coins to 0 (i.e. taking the gold coin).

After that, all that’s left to do is to ensure the stack of coins is a multiple of 3 whenever it’s your friend’s turn. Since 20 coins isn’t a multiple of 3, but 18 is, you should choose to go first and take 2 coins.

Extending the previous solution, we want to find this “magic number” for this version of the game. 3 will no longer cut it, because your friend can take more than 3 coins at once on his turn. Our new number is 11: one more than the maximum number of coins your friend can take on his turn. We can again check that it satisfies our earlier 2 conditions:
- Your friend cannot remove 11 coins at once on his turn
- After your friend’s turn (taking 1 to 10 coins), you can always make a move (taking 10 to 1 coins) such that you both reduce the stack by 11 coins.

Now, all you have to do is to remove the first coin, to bring the stack down to 99 coins: a multiple of 11. Whenever your friend takes 1 to 10 coins, you can always take $11 - x$ coins to bring the stack down to the next lower multiple of 11. This continues until the stack is 11 coins high. He can take between 1 to 10 coins, and you’ll take the remaining coins, including the gold coin.
