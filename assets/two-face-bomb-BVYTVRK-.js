<p>The diabolical Two-Face has acquired an atomic bomb, and is setting it to detonate somewhere in Gotham City in 2 days. Two-Face plans to deactivate the bomb only if the mayor agrees to pay him 2 bazillion dollars. The bomb can be deactivated with a 2,000 digit passcode that only Two-Face will know. In signature style, Two-Face wants exactly half of the passcode digits to be "2"s, and the other half to be "1"s.</p>
<p>Two-Face anticipates that Batman, the world's greatest detective, will probably find the bomb somehow. To reduce chances of Batman cracking the passcode and foiling the plan, Two-Face wants to choose a passcode equally at random, and without sacrificing the aforementioned symmetry. One way of doing this would be to just conjure "2"s and "1"s randomly off the top of his head, while making sure that in the end, the total number of "2"s equals the total number of "1"s. However, Two-Face doesn't trust his mind to be truly random. It sure would be nice if he had a computer or calculator to generate random numbers, but there are no such devices nearby. So Two-Face once again pulls out his fair-sided coin, the elegant tool he uses to make all decisions in life. Using only his coin, how can Two-Face construct a satisfactory passcode equally at random? And at least how long / how many flips will the construction take?</p>
