3 overlapping circles are drawn to cut the plane into 7 finite regions, each with 3 circular arcs as its boundary. 7 coins are placed, 1 in each region, all Heads-Up. Then a game is played, consisting of a sequence of coin flipping steps. At each step a circle is chosen, and one of the following two operations is performed upon all coins in it:

Operation A: Turn every coin Heads-Up.  
Operation B: Reverse every coin.

The object of the game is to put the coin in the central (inside-most) region Heads-Down, and all other coins Heads-Up. Is this objective accomplishable?

Hint: Consider what each kind of operation will do the following predicate concerning an odd number of coins: "Every circle has an odd number of conis Heads-Down."
