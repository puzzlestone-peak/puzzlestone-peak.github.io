<p>Let us distinguish Towns from Cities. Airlines avoid cancelling service between cities for fear of losing busy airports’ gate assignments to competitors. However, in hard times, airlines do cancel nonstop services between towns, and sometimes cancel nonstop services between towns and cities. The FAA insists that every town be connected to at least one city by nonstop airline service. Every town is so connected now, and some towns to more than one city. Suppose that, for every collection of towns, the number of towns in the collection does not exceed the number of cities each connected currently by nonstop airline service to at least one town in the collection. Show how airlines can cancel some city«town nonstop flight services leaving no city connected to more than one town and yet every town connected to just one city, barely satisfying the FAA, without adding any new service to the flight-schedule.
