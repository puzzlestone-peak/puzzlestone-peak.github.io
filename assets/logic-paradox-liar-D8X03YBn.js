# The Strengthened Liar

Consider this statement:

> "This sentence is not true."

This is subtly different from "This sentence is false."

# Why It's Stronger

Some philosophers try to escape the Liar's Paradox by saying the sentence is neither true nor false — it's **meaningless** or lacks a truth value.

But the Strengthened Liar defeats this escape:
- If the sentence is **true**, then what it says is correct, so it is **not true** (contradiction)
- If the sentence is **false**, then what it says is incorrect, so it **is true** (contradiction)
- If the sentence is **neither true nor false** (meaningless), then it is "not true" (as the sentence claims), making it **true** (contradiction)

# The Question

Can we escape this paradox? Or does it reveal something fundamental about the nature of truth and language?

:::hint
Even declaring the sentence meaningless doesn't help. Why?
:::

:::hint[Hierarchy of Truth]
What if we need different "levels" of truth?
:::

:::solution
**Answer**: The Liar's Revenge shows that simple three-valued logic (true, false, meaningless) isn't enough. We need more sophisticated approaches.

## Why It's Called "Revenge"

This is called the **Liar's Revenge** because it "takes revenge" on attempted solutions to the original Liar's Paradox.

The trap: By saying "not true" instead of "false," the sentence captures:
- False statements
- Meaningless statements
- Any other non-true status

So declaring it meaningless just makes it true!

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Tarski's Hierarchy

Alfred Tarski proposed that truth must be hierarchical:
- Object language (level 0): "Snow is white"
- Metalanguage (level 1): "'Snow is white' is true"
- Meta-metalanguage (level 2): "''Snow is white' is true' is true"

Each level can discuss truth for the level below, but not for itself. This prevents self-reference.

**Problem**: Natural language doesn't respect this hierarchy. We freely mix levels in everyday speech.

### 2. Paraconsistent Logic

Allow statements to be both true and false simultaneously without exploding the entire logical system (ex contradictione quodlibet).

**Problem**: Loses the principle of non-contradiction, which many find unacceptable.

### 3. Contextual Approaches

The sentence's truth value changes depending on the context of evaluation. Different contexts give different answers, but no context can give a stable answer for itself.

**Problem**: Requires tracking complex context dependencies.

### 4. Non-classical Semantics

Use infinite-valued logic, fuzzy logic, or other non-classical systems where truth is not binary.

**Problem**: Adds complexity and doesn't fully eliminate all versions of the paradox.

## Philosophical Implications

The Liar's Revenge suggests that:
1. Natural language is inherently expressive enough to create paradoxes
2. Any formal system powerful enough to talk about its own truth will face similar issues
3. Truth might not be a simple, uniform property
4. We may need to accept that some questions don't have answers

## Connection to Gödel

Kurt Gödel used a similar self-referential technique (though not quite the Liar's Paradox) to prove his incompleteness theorems, showing that any sufficiently powerful formal system cannot prove its own consistency.

The Liar's Paradox and its relatives aren't just curiosities — they reveal deep limitations in our ability to formalize truth and reasoning.
