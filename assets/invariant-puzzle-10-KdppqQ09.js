Starting with the list of numbers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, we are allowed to swap any two adjacent entries. Can we get back the original list after 5 swaps? Comment: After each swap, the number of inversions (i.e. the pairs of numbers where the bigger number comes before the smaller number) changes by 1.
