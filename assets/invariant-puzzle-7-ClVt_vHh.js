<p>Setup: This is a game between two players. Player 1 writes atleast ten signs on the board each of which is either + or −. Player 2 erases any two signs and replaces them with a + sign if they were equal and a − sign if they were unequal. Player 2 repeatedly does this until there is only one sign on the board. Player 1 wins if it is a + sign and player 2 wins if it is a − sign. Idea: Thinking of the signs as +1 and −1, the product of the numbers is an invariant.</p>

Setup: This is a game between two players. Player 1 writes atleast ten signs on the board each of which is either + or −. Player 2 erases any two signs and replaces them with a + sign if they were equal and a − sign if they were unequal. Player 2 repeatedly does this until there is only one sign on the board. Player 1 wins if it is a + sign and player 2 wins if it is a − sign. Idea: Thinking of the signs as +1 and −1, the product of the numbers is an invariant.
