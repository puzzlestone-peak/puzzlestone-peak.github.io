Choose to go first and take 1 coin. After that, when your friend makes a move, take 11 - \\[the number of coins he took\\].

By taking the first coin, you bring the stack down to 99 coins: a multiple of 11. Whenever your friend takes 1 to 10 coins, you can always take 11 -\\[the number of coins he took\\] to bring the stack down to the next lower multiple of 11. This continues until the stack is 11 coins high. He can take between 1 to 10 coins, and you’ll take the remaining coins, including the gold coin.
