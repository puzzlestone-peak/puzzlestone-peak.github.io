<p>Willywutang is holding a birthday party. Either p or q people are going to show up, where p and q are relatively prime numbers. Willy wants to cut the cake beforehand, so his guests will not waste time waiting for slices to be carved out. What is the smallest number of slices Willy must cut out such that every guest can be given the same amount of cake, regardless of whether p or q people show up? The slices do not have to be equally sized, and each guest could receive more than one slice. Also, Willy is not allowed to eat the whole cake and give nothing to all the guests. Also, the entire cake must be distributed amongst the guests -- there can be no leftovers.</p>`,rawContent:`<!-- Difficulty: \\[todo\\] -->
