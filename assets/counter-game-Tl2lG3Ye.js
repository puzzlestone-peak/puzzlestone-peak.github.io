Alice and Bob are going to play a game, with the following rules:

Alice picks a probability p, 0 \\<= p \\< 0.5  
Bob takes any finite number of counters B.  
Alice takes any finite number of counters A.  
These happen in sequence, so Bob chooses B knowing p, and Alice chooses A knowing p and B.

A series of rounds are then played. Each round, either Bob gives Alice a counter (probability p) or Alice gives Bob a counter (probability 1-p). The game terminates when one player is out of counters, and that player is the loser.

Whom does this game favor? Analyze and discuss probabilities.
