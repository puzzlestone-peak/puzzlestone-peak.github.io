In an presidential election between Willywutang and Billybutane, the winning candidate Willywutang has received n+k votes, whereas Billybutane has received n votes. (n and k are positive integers.) If ballots are counted in a random order, what is the probability that Willywutang's accumulating count will always lead his opponent's, and why?
