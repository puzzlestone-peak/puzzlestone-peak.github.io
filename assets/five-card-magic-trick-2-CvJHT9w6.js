<p>This is a magic trick performed by two magicians, Alice and Bob, with one shuffled deck of N unique cards.

Carol then returns her chosen 5 cards to Alice. After looking at the 5 cards, Alice picks one of the 5 cards and gives it back to Carol.

This is a magic trick performed by two magicians, Alice and Bob, with one shuffled deck of N unique cards. (Nothing is mentioned about suits: you may consider these cards to be simply enumerated from 1 to N.) Alice asks a member of the audience, Carol, to randomly select 5 cards out of a deck. Carol then returns her chosen 5 cards to Alice. After looking at the 5 cards, Alice picks one of the 5 cards and gives it back to Carol. Alice then arranges the other four cards in some way, and gives them to Bob in a neat, face-down pile. Bob examines these 4 cards and determines what card is in Carol's hand (the missing 5th card). Carol is astonished!
