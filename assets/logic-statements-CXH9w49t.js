Below are 10 statements, all either true or false:

1. At least one of statements 9 and 10 is true.  
2. This is either the first true statement or the first false stament.  
3. There are three consecutive false statements.  
4. The difference between the number of the last true statement and the first true statement divides the number which is to be found.  
5. The sum of the numbers of the true statements is the number which is to be found.  
6. This is not the last true statement.  
7. The number of each true statement divides the number which is to be found.  
8. The number that is to be found is the percentage of true statements.  
9. The number of divisors of the number that is to be found (apart from 1 and itself) is greater than the sum of the numbers of the true statements.  
10. There are no three consecutive true statements.

Find the minimum admissible number (which is to be found).
