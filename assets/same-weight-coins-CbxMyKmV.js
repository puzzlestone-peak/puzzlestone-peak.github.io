Suppose an odd number (at least three) of coins have the property that, if any one coin is removed, the rest can be partitioned into two groups each with the same number of coins and also the same total weight. Show that all the coins must have the same weight.

Note: Linear algebra can be useful here, but I don't know if it's absolutely necessary.
