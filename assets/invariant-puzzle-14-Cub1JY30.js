<p>Setup: Draw a connected graph with 8 nodes and 7 edges. This is a game between two<br>
players. Players take turns coloring uncolored nodes. Player 1 colors red and player 2 colors<br>
blue. Player 1 wins if there are odd number of red-blue edges. Player 2 wins if there are even<br>
number of red-blue edges.<br>
Idea: Player 1 can always force a win. The color of the two end nodes determine the parity<br>
of the number of red-blue edges.</p>`,rawContent:`<!-- Difficulty: \\[todo\\] -->

Setup: Draw a connected graph with 8 nodes and 7 edges. This is a game between two  
players. Players take turns coloring uncolored nodes. Player 1 colors red and player 2 colors  
blue. Player 1 wins if there are odd number of red-blue edges. Player 2 wins if there are even  
number of red-blue edges.  
Idea: Player 1 can always force a win. The color of the two end nodes determine the parity  
of the number of red-blue edges.
