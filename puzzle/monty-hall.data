There are three doors in front of you:\n- Behind one door is a brand new car\n- Behind the other two doors are goats\n\nThe host asks you to pick a door. You pick Door 1.\n\nThe host, who knows what's behind every door, opens Door 3 to reveal a goat.\n\nThe host now asks: \"Would you like to switch to Door 2, or stick with Door 1?\"\n\n# The Question\n\nShould you switch doors, stick with your original choice, or does it not matter?\n\n:::hint\nThink about what the host knows when they choose which door to open.\n:::\n\n:::hint[Counting Possibilities]\nConsider all the possible arrangements of the car and goats, and what happens in each case.\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Answer**: You should always switch doors.\n\nWhen you first picked a door, you had a 1/3 chance of picking the car. That means there's a 2/3 chance the car is behind one of the other two doors.\n\nWhen the host opens a door with a goat, they're giving you information. The host *must* open a door with a goat (they can't reveal the car), so they're effectively eliminating one wrong choice for you.\n\nHere's what happens in all cases:\n\n1. If you initially picked the car (1/3 probability):\n   - The host opens either of the other doors (both have goats)\n   - Switching loses\n\n2. If you initially picked goat #1 (1/3 probability):\n   - The host must open the door with goat #2\n   - Switching wins (reveals the car)\n\n3. If you initially picked goat #2 (1/3 probability):\n   - The host must open the door with goat #1\n   - Switching wins (reveals the car)\n\nSwitching wins in 2 out of 3 cases, giving you a 2/3 (≈67%) chance of winning.\nStaying wins in only 1 out of 3 cases, giving you a 1/3 (≈33%) chance.\n\nThe key insight: your initial choice was random, but the host's choice is *not* random — they must avoid the car. This asymmetry creates the advantage.\n:::\n","dynamicBlocks",[]]
