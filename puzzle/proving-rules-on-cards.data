This means we can leave the “D” card alone.\n\nIf we encounter a card with a vowel on one side, we should check if the number on the other side is even. If it is odd, we know that the statement isn’t true. However, if it is odd, we know that the statement *could* be true, we just need to check the other cards. So we’ll have to flip over the “A” card.\n\nIf we see a card with an even number on one side, notice from the table that it doesn’t give us additional information whether or not the statement is invalid. After all, the statement doesn’t say that a card with a consonant must have an odd number on the other side. We can actually leave the “6” card alone.\n\nIf we see a card with an odd number on one side, notice from the table that if we see a vowel, we know that the statement is wrong.
