Each day, the warden randomly selects one prisoner to visit a special room containing only a light switch. The switch has two positions: **on** and **off**. Initially, the switch is **off**.\n\nWhen a prisoner visits the room, they may:\n- Toggle the switch (change it from on to off, or off to on)\n- Leave it unchanged\n\nAfter visiting the room, the prisoner returns to their cell.\n\n# The Challenge\n\nAt any time, any prisoner may declare to the warden: \"All 100 prisoners have now visited the room at least once.\"\n\nIf this declaration is **true**, all prisoners go free.\nIf it's **false**, all prisoners remain imprisoned forever.\n\nThe prisoners are allowed to discuss and agree on a strategy **before** the process begins, but they cannot communicate afterward.\n\n**Can the prisoners devise a strategy that guarantees they will all eventually go free?**\n\n:::hint\nThe prisoners need to find a way to count visits. But how can they count when they can't communicate?\n:::\n\n:::hint[Role Assignment]\nConsider assigning special roles to certain prisoners. Maybe one prisoner acts as a \"counter\" while others act as \"reporters.\"\n:::\n\n:::hint[Binary State]\nThe light switch has two states. How can the prisoners use this binary state to encode information over multiple visits?\n:::\n\n:::solution\nYes! Here's a strategy that works:\n\n**Role Assignment**:\n- Designate one prisoner as the **Counter**\n- All other 99 prisoners are **Reporters**\n\n**Strategy**:\n\nFor **Reporters**:\n1. If this is your first or second time visiting the room, and the light is **off**, turn it **on**\n2. Otherwise, don't change the switch\n3. Each reporter will turn the light on exactly **twice** over the course of the game\n\nFor the **Counter**:\n1. If the light is **on**, turn it **off** and increment your mental count\n2. When your count reaches **198** (= 2 × 99 reporters), declare that all prisoners have visited\n\n**Why it works**:\n- Each of the 99 reporters will turn the light on exactly twice\n- The counter will eventually see the light on 198 times\n- Since only reporters turn the light on, and each reporter only turns it on twice, the counter knows that all 99 reporters have visited at least twice\n- The counter has also visited (to count), so all 100 prisoners have visited\n- The strategy is guaranteed to succeed eventually, though it may take a long time depending on the random selection\n\n**Time Complexity**:\nThis strategy works but may take many years on average! Can you think of a faster strategy?\n:::\n\n:::solution[Optimized Strategy]\nA faster approach uses the same roles but allows reporters to signal on their first visit only:\n\n**Optimized Strategy**:\n- Each reporter turns the light on only **once** (on their first visit when it's off)\n- The counter counts to **99** instead of 198\n- This reduces the expected time by roughly half\n\nThe tradeoff: reporters only signal once, so the counter needs to see 99 signals instead of 198, but each signal is more \"valuable.\"\n:::\n\n# Extensions\n\n1. What if the initial state of the switch is unknown?\n2. What if prisoners can be selected multiple times in a row?\n3. Can you calculate the expected number of days until freedom?\n","dynamicBlocks",[]]
