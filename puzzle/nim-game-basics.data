If so, what's your winning strategy?\n\n:::hint\nWork backwards from the end. What positions force your opponent to lose?\n:::\n\n:::hint[Positions of Power]\nIf you leave your opponent with 4 stones, they can't prevent you from taking the last stone.\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Answer**: Yes! Take 3 stones on your first move, then mirror your opponent's moves.\n\nIf there are 4 stones left on your opponent's turn, you've won:\n- If they take 1, you take 3 (last stone)\n- If they take 2, you take 2 (last stone)\n- If they take 3, you take 1 (last stone)\n\nThe winning strategy:\n1. Take 3 stones initially (leaving 9)\n2. After each of their moves, take enough stones so that the total removed (yours + theirs) equals 4\n\nFor example:\n- Start: 12 stones\n- You take 3 → 9 stones remain\n- They take 2 → 7 stones remain\n- You take 2 (total of 4) → 5 stones remain\n- They take 1 → 4 stones remain\n- You take 3 (total of 4) → 1 stone remains\n- They take 1 → 0 stones remain\n- You win!\n\nThe key insight: positions where the number of stones is a multiple of 4 are losing positions for the player whose turn it is. By taking 3 stones first, you leave 9 stones (not divisible by 4), forcing your opponent into a losing position.\n\nWant to explore more?
