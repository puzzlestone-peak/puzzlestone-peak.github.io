That’s a total of 49 drops + the first drop for a total of 50.\n\n**Case 2**: If the device doesn’t break at the 50th floor, we can drop the device once more on any floor in the middle, so let’s go with the 75th floor. If it breaks, we can test floors 51 to 74 for a total of 26 drops in the worst case. If it doesn’t break, we can still test the remaining 25 floors with a naive brute force solution and still come up with 27 drops in total. Either way, you cannot do as bad as the 50 drops required in case 1.\n:::\n::::\n\n::::solution\n**Answer**: 14 drops.\n\nLet’s work our way up to a solution. As we’ve seen from the hints, once the device has broken, you will need to brute force ALL the remaining floors in the worst case scenario. But how do we optimise this then?\n\nFirst, let’s start with a simpler version of the problem with 6 floors and 2 devices. We’ll start with a naive solution for now:\n\n- First drop: Drop from floor 3.\n    - If it breaks, test floor 1, then 2. Worst case: 3 moves.\n    - If it doesn’t break, drop from floor 6.\n        - If it breaks, test floor 4, then 5. Worst case: 4 moves.\n        - If it doesn’t break, then we know the device survives all 6 floors.\n\nThis gives us a worst case of 4 moves.\n\nLet’s come up with a way to visualise this. We indicate the drops with device 1 on a horizontal line. We start from the left point, and each step to the right indicates a drop.\n\n:::dynamic\n```yaml\nuse: '#strategy-tree'\ntitle: \"Simple strategy: drop from floor 3, then floor 6\"\nariaLabel: Three nodes in a horizontal chain — start, floor 3, floor 6\nprops:\n  columns:\n    - \"S\"\n    - \"3\"\n    - \"6\"\n```\n:::\n\nWhen the device breaks on a specific floor, we can no longer make a horizontal step, so we must now take vertical steps downward. From hint 2, we know that once we’re left with 1 device, we must test all the floors sequentially. If the device breaks at floor 3, we need to test floors 1 and 2. If the device breaks at floor 6, we need to test floors 4 and 5. This gives us the following diagram:\n\n:::dynamic\n```yaml\nuse: '#strategy-tree'\ntitle: \"Strategy tree: floors 3 and 6 with fallback chains\"\nariaLabel: Strategy tree with start node, floor 3 with chain 1 and 2 below, floor 6 with chain 4 and 5 below\nprops:\n  columns:\n    - \"S\"\n    - label: \"3\"\n      chain: [1, 2]\n    - label: \"6\"\n      chain: [4, 5]\n  showDepth: true\n```\n:::\n\nWe can see from this diagram that we have a worst-case of 4 moves (Start → 3 → 6 → 4 → 5). Can we do better? Let’s try a different strategy:\n\n- First drop: Drop from floor 2.\n    - If it breaks, test floor 1. Worst case: 2 moves.\n    - If it doesn’t break, drop from floor 4.\n        - If it breaks, test floor 3. Worst case: 3 moves.\n        - If it doesn’t break, test floor 6.\n            - If it breaks, test floor 5. Worst case: 4 moves\n            - If it doesn’t break, then we know the device survives all 6 floors.\n\n:::dynamic\n```yaml\nuse: '#strategy-tree'\ntitle: \"Strategy tree: floors 2, 4, and 6 with single fallbacks\"\nariaLabel: Strategy tree with start, floor 2 dropping to 1, floor 4 dropping to 3, floor 6 dropping to 5\nprops:\n  columns:\n    - \"S\"\n    - label: \"2\"\n      chain: [1]\n    - label: \"4\"\n      chain: [3]\n    - label: \"6\"\n      chain: [5]\n  showDepth: true\n```\n:::\n\nHmm, we’re still stuck with a worst-case of 4 moves (Start → 2 → 4 → 6 → 5).

In hint 3, we offered a naive solution of dropping from the 50th floor. Visualising it with our new diagram, it looks like this:\n\n\n:::dynamic\n```yaml\nuse: '#strategy-tree'\ntitle: \"Strategy tree: binary split from floor 50\"\nariaLabel: Strategy tree showing drops from floors 50, 75, and 100 with long fallback chains\nprops:\n  columns:\n    - \"S\"\n    - label: \"50\"\n      chain: [1, 2, \"...\", \"...\", \"...\", \"...\", 49]\n    - label: \"75\"\n      chain: [51, 52, \"...\", 74]\n    - label: \"100\"\n      chain: [76, 77, \"...\", 98, 99]\n  showDepth: true\n  minWidth: 350\n```\n:::\n\nOof, that’s rough. It seems like we’re not taking proper advantage of the first device (the rightward movement on the diagram). So instead of making such huge jumps with the first device, we should instead move it in smaller steps.\n\nHow about steps of 10? This time, we’ll try dropping the first device from floor 10, then 20, then 30, and so on. At the first floor that it breaks on, we will test the remaining floors in between the last 2 drops. For example, if the first device breaks on floor 60, then we will drop the second device from floor 51, 52, ..., 59.

But notice how the shorter chains have only 10 moves, 11 moves, and so on? Let’s lengthen them. Instead of having the first drop at 10, we can have the first drop at 14 (a jump of 14). Then our next jump should be $14 + 13 = 27$. Then the following drop should be $27 + 12 = 39$. Continuing this way, we get a chart of:\n\n:::dynamic\n```yaml\nuse: '#strategy-tree'\ntitle: \"Optimal strategy tree for 100 floors\"\nariaLabel: Strategy tree with decreasing jumps starting at floor 14, covering all 100 floors in at most 14 drops\nprops:\n  columns:\n    - \"S\"\n    - label: \"14\"\n      chain: { from: 1, to: 13 }\n    - label: \"27\"\n      chain: { from: 15, to: 26 }\n    - label: \"39\"\n      chain: { from: 28, to: 38 }\n    - label: \"50\"\n      chain: { from: 40, to: 49 }\n    - label: \"60\"\n      chain: { from: 51, to: 59 }\n    - label: \"69\"\n      chain: { from: 61, to: 68 }\n    - label: \"77\"\n      chain: { from: 70, to: 76 }\n    - label: \"84\"\n      chain: { from: 78, to: 83 }\n    - label: \"90\"\n      chain: { from: 85, to: 89 }\n    - label: \"95\"\n      chain: { from: 91, to: 94 }\n    - label: \"99\"\n      chain: { from: 96, to: 98 }\n    - \"100\"\n  showDepth: true\n  minWidth: 700\n```\n:::\n\nIn the worst case scenario, we have 14 moves, and we can’t do any better than this.
