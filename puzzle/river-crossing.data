Take the chicken across (leave fox and grain on the starting side)\n2. Return empty-handed (chicken on far side, fox and grain on starting side)\n3. Take the fox across (or the grain — either works)\n4. Bring the chicken back (fox on far side, chicken and grain on starting side)\n5. Take the grain across (leave chicken on starting side)\n6. Return empty-handed (fox and grain on far side, chicken on starting side)\n7. Take the chicken across (everyone now on far side)\n\nThe key insight is step 4: bringing the chicken back. This ensures the chicken is never left alone with either the fox or the grain.\n\nAlternative solution using grain instead of fox in step 3:\n1. Take chicken across\n2. Return empty\n3. Take grain across\n4. Bring chicken back\n5. Take fox across\n6. Return empty\n7. Take chicken across\n\nBoth solutions work because they follow the same principle: the chicken (the \"middle\" of the food chain) must not be left with either of the others.\n:::\n","dynamicBlocks",[]]
