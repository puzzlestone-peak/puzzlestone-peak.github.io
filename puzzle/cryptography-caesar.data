For example, with a shift of 3, A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on. Z wraps around to C.\n\nA message \"ATTACK AT DAWN\" with shift 3 becomes \"DWWDFN DW GDZQ\".\n\n# The Challenge\n\nYou intercept an encrypted message using a Caesar cipher but don't know the shift value. The message is in English.\n\n**Part A**: How many possible shifts exist for the 26-letter English alphabet?\n\n**Part B**: Design an efficient strategy to break a Caesar cipher without testing every possible shift manually.\n\n**Part C**: The Caesar cipher is considered completely insecure today. Why? What fundamental property makes it trivial to break?\n\n:::hint\nFor Part A, consider what happens when you shift by 26 positions.\n:::\n\n:::hint\nFor Part B, English text has predictable patterns. Some letters appear far more frequently than others.\n:::\n\n:::hint\nLetter frequency in English: E (13%), T (9%), A (8%), O (8%), I (7%), N (7%), S (6%), H (6%). Rare letters include Q, X, Z.\n:::\n\n:::hint\nFor Part C, think about the relationship between the key space (number of possible keys) and modern computing power.\n:::\n\n:::solution\n**Answer**: A) 25 meaningful shifts (shift 0 is no encryption, shift 26 is identical to shift 0). B) Use frequency analysis. C) The key space is far too small.\n\n## Part A: Key Space\n\nSince the English alphabet has 26 letters, there are 26 possible shift values (0 through 25). However, a shift of 0 means no encryption at all, and a shift of 26 returns us to the original message. Therefore, there are effectively **25 meaningful encryption keys**.\n\n## Part B: Breaking the Cipher\n\nThe most efficient approach uses **frequency analysis**:\n\n1. **Count letter frequencies** in the encrypted text\n2. **Identify the most common letter** in the ciphertext\n3. **Assume it represents 'E'** (the most common letter in English)\n4. **Calculate the shift** from E to that letter\n5. **Test the decryption** — if it produces readable English, you've found the key\n6. **If not, try the next most common letters** (T, A, O)\n\nFor example, if 'H' is most frequent in the ciphertext, the shift is likely 3 (E → H). Shift all letters back by 3 to decrypt.\n\nFor very short messages, frequency analysis may be unreliable. In that case, testing all 25 possibilities is still trivial.\n\n## Part C: Why It's Insecure\n\nThe Caesar cipher has a **key space of only 25**.
