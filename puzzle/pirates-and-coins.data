Being logical and ruthless pirates, they must decide how to divide the loot. They follow a strict hierarchy based on rank, with Pirate 1 being the most senior down to Pirate 5 being the most junior.\n\nThe process works as follows: the most senior pirate proposes a distribution of the coins. All pirates (including the proposer) then vote on whether to accept the proposal. If at least half of the pirates vote in favour, the proposal is accepted and the coins are distributed accordingly. If the proposal is rejected, the proposer is thrown overboard, and the process repeats with the next most senior pirate.\n\nEach pirate’s priorities are, in order of decreasing importance:\n1. survive,\n2. maximise their own coins, and\n3. throw other pirates overboard.\n\nWhat distribution should Pirate 1 propose to maximise their coins whilst ensuring survival?\n\n:::hint\nStart by analysing what would happen if there were only 2 pirates left.\n:::\n\n:::hint\nWork backwards from the simplest scenario to understand what each pirate would get in subsequent rounds.\n:::\n\n:::hint\nPirate 1 needs to secure exactly 3 votes (including their own) to pass the proposal.\n:::\n\n:::solution\nPirate 1 should propose: 98 coins for themselves, 0 for Pirate 2, 1 for Pirate 3, 0 for Pirate 4, and 1 for Pirate 5.\n\nLet’s work backwards from the simplest case.\n\n**2 pirates remaining (Pirates 4 and 5)**: Pirate 4 proposes 100 for themselves, 0 for Pirate 5.
