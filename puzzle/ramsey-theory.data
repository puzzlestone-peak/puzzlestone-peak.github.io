C) This is R(m,n), the Ramsey number — mostly unknown!\n\n## Part A: Six People Guarantee a Monochromatic Triangle\n\nWe'll prove this using graph theory. Represent the six people as vertices. Draw edges between vertices, colouring them:\n- **Red** if the two people are friends\n- **Blue** if the two people are strangers\n\nWe need to prove that any such colouring must contain either a red triangle (three mutual friends) or a blue triangle (three mutual strangers).\n\n**Proof:**\n\nPick any person, call them Alice. Alice has 5 edges connecting her to the other 5 people.\n\nBy the **pigeonhole principle**, since there are 5 edges and only 2 colours, at least ⌈5/2⌉ = 3 edges must be the same colour. Without loss of generality, assume at least 3 edges from Alice are red (the argument is symmetric for blue).\n\nLet's say Alice is friends with Bob, Carol, and Dave (three red edges from Alice).\n\nNow consider the three edges between Bob, Carol, and Dave:\n- **Case 1**: If any of these edges is red (say Bob-Carol), then we have a red triangle: Alice-Bob-Carol ✓\n- **Case 2**: If all three edges are blue, then Bob-Carol-Dave forms a blue triangle ✓\n\nIn both cases, we've found a monochromatic triangle. Therefore, any colouring of six people must contain either three mutual friends or three mutual strangers. ∎\n\n## Part B: Five People Don't Guarantee a Triangle\n\nWith five people, we can avoid monochromatic triangles. Here's a construction:\n\nArrange 5 people in a pentagon: A, B, C, D, E (in order around the pentagon).\n\n**Colouring**:\n- **Red edges** (friends): A-B, B-C, C-D, D-E, E-A (the pentagon edges)\n- **Blue edges** (strangers): A-C, C-E, E-B, B-D, D-A (the star inside)\n\nCheck all triangles:\n- A-B-C: red, red, blue (not monochromatic)\n- B-C-D: red, red, blue\n- C-D-E: red, red, blue\n- D-E-A: red, red, blue\n- E-A-B: red, red, blue\n- A-C-E: blue, blue, red\n- C-E-B: blue, blue, red\n- E-B-D: blue, blue, red\n- B-D-A: blue, blue, red\n- D-A-C: blue, blue, red\n\nNo triangle has all three edges the same colour! Therefore, **five people are not enough**.\n\nThis colouring is called the **Ramsey graph R(3,3) - 1** or the **cycle graph C₅** with complementary colouring.\n\n## Part C: Ramsey Numbers R(m,n)\n\nThe **Ramsey number R(m,n)** is the minimum number of people needed to guarantee either:\n- m mutual friends, OR\n- n mutual strangers\n\nFrom Parts A and B:\n- R(3,3) = 6 (six people guarantee three mutual friends or three mutual strangers)\n- Five people are insufficient, so R(3,3) > 5\n\n**Known Ramsey Numbers**:\n- R(3,3) = 6 (we just proved this!)\n- R(3,4) = 9\n- R(3,5) = 14\n- R(4,4) = 18\n- R(3,6) = 18\n- R(3,7) = 23\n- R(3,8) = 28\n- R(3,9) = 36\n- R(4,5) = 25\n\n**Unknown Ramsey Numbers**:\nMost Ramsey numbers are unknown! For example:\n- 43 ≤ R(5,5) ≤ 48 (we only know it's in this range!)\n- 102 ≤ R(6,6) ≤ 165\n\nComputing Ramsey numbers is extraordinarily difficult.
