And what is the minimum number of prisoners needed to do so?\n\n:::hint\nIf the king had 999 prisoners, he could serve 1 bottle to each prisoner, leaving the 1000th bottle alone.

Since each prisoner either lives or dies, with 9 prisoners there would be $2^9 = 512$ different combinations of outcomes — not enough to distinguish the 1000 bottles of wine.\n\n10 prisoners gives us $2^{10} = 1024$ outcomes, allowing us to distinguish up to 1024 bottles of wine.
