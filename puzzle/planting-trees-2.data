She was so pleased with your creative solution to the four-tree problem that she has another challenge for you.\n\nThis time, she wants you to plant ten trees in five straight lines, with exactly four trees in each line. Can you arrange ten trees to satisfy her requirements?\n\n:::hint\nTrees can belong to more than one line.\n:::\n\n::::solution\n**Answer**: Arrange the trees in a pentagram (five-pointed star).\n\nPlace five trees at the vertices of a regular pentagon. These form the five outer points of the star.\n\nNow draw the five diagonals connecting non-adjacent vertices. These lines intersect inside the pentagon, creating five intersection points. Place the remaining five trees at these intersection points. Each diagonal line of the pentagram now passes through exactly four trees.\n\n:::dynamic\n```yaml\ntitle: \"Pentagram diagram with 10 trees\"\nuse: '#pentagram-diagram'\n```\n:::\n::::\n\n:::component[pentagram-diagram]\n```js\nfunction draw(options) {\n  const { canvas, api, width } = options;\n  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\n\n  // Responsive sizing\n  const size = Math.min(width, 400);\n  const height = size;\n\n  canvas.width = size;\n  canvas.height = height;\n\n  // Get theme colors\n  const primaryColor = api.getColor('primary');\n  const treeColor = api.getColor('evergreen-700');\n\n  // Clear canvas\n  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);\n\n  // Calculate pentagram geometry\n  const centerX = size / 2;\n  const centerY = height / 2;\n  const outerRadius = size * 0.4;\n  const innerRadius = outerRadius * 0.382; // Golden ratio for pentagram inner points\n\n  // Calculate the 5 outer vertices (regular pentagon)\n  const outerVertices = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n    const angle = (Math.PI / 2) + (i * 2 * Math.PI / 5);\n    const x = centerX + outerRadius * Math.cos(angle);\n    const y = centerY - outerRadius * Math.sin(angle);\n    outerVertices.push({ x, y });\n  }\n\n  // Calculate the 5 inner intersection points\n  const innerVertices = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n    const angle = (Math.PI / 2) + (i * 2 * Math.PI / 5) + (Math.PI / 5);\n    const x = centerX + innerRadius * Math.cos(angle);\n    const y = centerY - innerRadius * Math.sin(angle);\n    innerVertices.push({ x, y });\n  }\n\n  // Draw the 5 pentagram lines\n  ctx.strokeStyle = primaryColor;\n  ctx.lineWidth = 2;\n  ctx.lineCap = 'round';\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n    const start = outerVertices[i];\n    const end = outerVertices[(i + 2) % 5];\n\n    ctx.beginPath();\n    ctx.moveTo(start.x, start.y);\n    ctx.lineTo(end.x, end.y);\n    ctx.stroke();\n  }\n\n  // Draw the trees\n  const treeRadius = size * 0.025;\n\n  const drawTree = (x, y) => {\n    ctx.fillStyle = treeColor;\n    ctx.strokeStyle = api.getColor('evergreen-950');\n    ctx.lineWidth = 1.5;\n\n    ctx.beginPath();\n    ctx.arc(x, y, treeRadius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);\n    ctx.fill();\n    ctx.stroke();\n  };\n\n  outerVertices.forEach(vertex => drawTree(vertex.x, vertex.y));\n  innerVertices.forEach(vertex => drawTree(vertex.x, vertex.y));\n}\n```\n:::\n","dynamicBlocks",[43],{"_44":45,"_46":47,"_48":49,"_15":50,"_51":52},"type","dynamic","mode","component","componentId","#pentagram-diagram","Pentagram diagram with 10 trees","sourceFile","/home/runner/work/puzzlestone-peak/puzzlestone-peak/apps/web/content/puzzles/geometry/planting-trees/planting-trees-2.md","inlineComponents",{"_55":56},"pentagram-diagram",{"_13":55,"_57":58,"_59":60},"code","function draw(options) {\n  const { canvas, api, width } = options;\n  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\n\n  // Responsive sizing\n  const size = Math.min(width, 400);\n  const height = size;\n\n  canvas.width = size;\n  canvas.height = height;\n\n  // Get theme colors\n  const primaryColor = api.getColor('primary');\n  const treeColor = api.getColor('evergreen-700');\n\n  // Clear canvas\n  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);\n\n  // Calculate pentagram geometry\n  const centerX = size / 2;\n  const centerY = height / 2;\n  const outerRadius = size * 0.4;\n  const innerRadius = outerRadius * 0.382; // Golden ratio for pentagram inner points\n\n  // Calculate the 5 outer vertices (regular pentagon)\n  const outerVertices = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n    const angle = (Math.PI / 2) + (i * 2 * Math.PI / 5);\n    const x = centerX + outerRadius * Math.cos(angle);\n    const y = centerY - outerRadius * Math.sin(angle);\n    outerVertices.push({ x, y });\n  }\n\n  // Calculate the 5 inner intersection points\n  const innerVertices = [];\n  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n    const angle = (Math.PI / 2) + (i * 2 * Math.PI / 5) + (Math.PI / 5);\n    const x = centerX + innerRadius * Math.cos(angle);\n    const y = centerY - innerRadius * Math.sin(angle);\n    innerVertices.push({ x, y });\n  }\n\n  // Draw the 5 pentagram lines\n  ctx.strokeStyle = primaryColor;\n  ctx.lineWidth = 2;\n  ctx.lineCap = 'round';\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n    const start = outerVertices[i];\n    const end = outerVertices[(i + 2) % 5];\n\n    ctx.beginPath();\n    ctx.moveTo(start.x, start.y);\n    ctx.lineTo(end.x, end.y);\n    ctx.stroke();\n  }\n\n  // Draw the trees\n  const treeRadius = size * 0.025;\n\n  const drawTree = (x, y) => {\n    ctx.fillStyle = treeColor;\n    ctx.strokeStyle = api.getColor('evergreen-950');\n    ctx.lineWidth = 1.5;\n\n    ctx.beginPath();\n    ctx.arc(x, y, treeRadius, 0, 2 * Math.PI);\n    ctx.fill();\n    ctx.stroke();\n  };\n\n  outerVertices.forEach(vertex => drawTree(vertex.x, vertex.y));\n  innerVertices.forEach(vertex => drawTree(vertex.x, vertex.y));\n}","startLine",42]
